! This the manifest file for the Parchment in-browser interpreter, and gives
! the necessary details to Inform's release component (called cBlorb) so that
! the interpreter can be bundled into a released website, all set up ready
! to play the IF story file being released.

! Manifest files have a simple format. They are allowed to set the value of
! any cBlorb placeholders that they would like to, but the ones below are the
! only ones they will likely want to set. These two are needed for the footer
! of the play page:

[INTERPRETERVERSION]
Vorple
[]

[INTERPRETERURL]
http://vorple-if.com
[]

! Note that we don't set [INTERPRETER]: cBlorb has already set that to the
! name of the interpreter, in this case, to "Vorple".

! This declares whether the interpreter can handle blorbed Z-machine files
! ("z"), blorbed Glulx files ("g") or both ("zg" or "gz"). No other values
! are legal; note lower case.

[INTERPRETERVM]
z
[]

! [INTERPRETERHEAD] provides code to go into the <head> ... </head> of the
! web page playing the work. (Placeholder text starts on the line after the
! name, and continues until a line reads just []. Line breaks are included
! between lines, though not at the end of the final line; white space is
! stripped out at the left and right hand edges of each line.)

! In writing the head and body, note that the structure of the site being
! constructed is:
!     play.html  <-- page on which the interpreter runs
!     interpreter
!         ...the base64-encoded story file...
!         ...any files copied over according to the manifest below...
! The placeholder [ENCODEDSTORYFILE] expands to the leafname of the base64
! version of the story file, which might be (but should not be assumed
! to be) "story.zblorb.js".

[INTERPRETERHEAD]
    <script type="text/javascript" src="interpreter/vorple.parchment.min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
	    // The loading message can be changed by setting a global variable
	    // vorpleLoaderMessage in a custom JavaScript file
    	$( function() {
    		$( '#vorpleLoader' ).html(
    		    typeof vorpleLoaderMessage === 'string' ? vorpleLoaderMessage : 'Loading...'
            );
    	});
	</script>
    
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="interpreter/vorple.css">

		parchment.options.lib_path = 'interpreter/';
		parchment.options.default_story = [ "[STORYFILE]", "interpreter/[ENCODEDSTORYFILE]" ];
		parchment.options.lock_story = 1;


		vorple.media.defaults.swfPath = 'interpreter/';
		vorple.media.defaults.audioPath = '.';

            vorple.core.init( parchment );
            parchment.init();
		});
	</script>
[]

! [INTERPRETERBODY] provides the part of the page where the window
! or gadget actually appears.

[INTERPRETERBODY]
<div id="vorpleContainer">
    <div id="vorple"><div id="vorpleLoader"></div></div>
    <div id="vorpleInput"></div>
    <div id="parchment"></div>
    <div class="clearAll"></div>
</div>

! The following footnote is added to the small print about how to play IF
! on the game's main page:

[INBROWSERPLAY]
Or you can play without downloading anything by following the 'Play In-Browser'
link, using the [INTERPRETER] interpreter. You'll need to have Javascript enabled
on your web browser.
[]

! cBlorb encodes the story file into base64 so that it can be loaded in
! Javascript despite being binary data. The encoding is topped and tailed
! with the following, in order to make the result a valid Javascript function
! call with a string argument:

[BASESIXTYFOURTOP]
processBase64Zcode('
[]

[BASESIXTYFOURTAIL]
')
[]

! Outside of the placeholder parts of the manifest, lines beginning '!', or
! lines which contain only white space, are thrown away; so this is a comment.

! Non-comment lines are the names of files which are copied across when the
! release is made. Anything not listed here won't be copied.
