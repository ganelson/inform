! This is a one-line Inform 7 game:
!    The Kitchen is a room.
! ...as compiled by I7 version 6M62. I keep it around as a test case:
! if the I6 compiler builds this into the same game file, I haven't broken
! it.
!
! This should compile to Glulx without errors. (But with a whole
! pile of warnings.)

! Floating-point parsing routines.

! Parse a float from a text buffer. Returns a float value, or FLOAT_NAN if
! no value was understood.
!
! The recognized format, if you'll pardon a slightly bastardized regexp
! syntax, is "S?D*(PD*)?(ES?D+)?" where S is a sign character "+" or "-",
! D is a decimal digit "0" to "9", P is a decimal point ".",
! and E is the exponential modifier "E" or "e".
!
! For flexibility, the string "M10^" is also accepted for E, where M is
! "X", "x", "*", or the multiplication sign @{D7}. Optional spaces are
! allowed before and after the M sign. (But only for the "10^" form of
! the exponent, not the "e" form.)
!
! This routine does not try to recognize special names for infinity or NaN,
! but it can return FLOAT_INFINITY or FLOAT_NINFINITY if the exponent is too
! large.
!
! This routine relies on floating-point math. Therefore, the same string
! may parse to slightly different float values on different interpreters!
! Be warned.
!
! If useall is true, this insists on using all len characters from the buffer.
! (It returns FLOAT_NAN if any unrecognized characters are left over.)
! Contrariwise, if useall is false, unused characters at the end of the buffer
! are fine. (But not at the beginning; the float must start at the beginning
! of the buffer.)
