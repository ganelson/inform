<h1>Inform Release Notes</h1>
<h3>Inform Compiler 6.34, 6.33, 6.32, 6.31, 6.30<br>Inform Library 6/11</h3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is a maintenance release of the Inform system for creating adventure games, intended to address 
issues that have arisen since the 6.21 compiler and 6/10 library files were released in 1999, and 
subsequently since the 6.30 compiler was released in 2004. The focus is primarily on fixing problems,
but a small number of enhancements are included.
<p>
Although just about all known bugs are fixed, the approach to enhancing Inform is more conservative. 
The selection of suggestions to implement has been governed by three factors:
<ul>
<li><p>avoidance of changes which might cause existing games to misbehave;
<li><p>minimisation of features which would require updates to the <i>Inform Designer&rsquo;s Manual</i>;
<li><p>essential simplicity. With Graham Nelson&rsquo;s permission, this release has been produced by a 
volunteer taskforce, whose enthusiasm has been tempered by a certain lack of familiarity with the 
internals of Inform. Thus, we have concentrated on &lsquo;safe&rsquo; changes; the implementation of some 
good ideas has been postponed until we are more confident that we know what we&rsquo;re doing.
</ul>
Having said that, this release does incorporate one major advance. It is based on Andrew Plotkin&rsquo;s 
bi-platform &mdash; Z-machine and Glulx &mdash; compiler and library files, which were in turn derived from the 
the 6.21 compiler and 6/10 library. The result is that the two Virtual Machine (VM) strands have 
merged into a single compiler and library which, although continuing by default to produce Z-code, 
can alternatively generate code for the Glulx VM if you supply the <tt>-G</tt> compiler switch. There&rsquo;s more 
on this topic in <a href="#Glulx">Support for Glulx</a>.
Before that, though, we&rsquo;ll summarise the changes to the compiler and to the library files.
<p>
If you&rsquo;ve translated the 6/10 library into another language, you may find
<a href="#Translate">Information for translators</a> helpful.

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
Far too many people contributed towards this release &mdash; reporting and resolving bugs, making helpful 
suggestions, providing support and facilities, testing, and so on &mdash; for their names to be individually 
listed. So instead, this is a general thank-you to everybody who has made this release happen, and 
specific ones to Graham for permitting it in the first place, and to Andrew for his pioneering work on 
Glulx.
There are, naturally, sure to be imperfections in the release, and these should be reported through the
<a href="http://inform7.com/mantis/">Inform bug tracker</a>.

<h2>Compiler 6.34</h2>
These are the changes delivered in version 6.34 of the Inform compiler.
<h3>Features added</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The following system constants are now supported for Glulx:
<tt>#highest_class_number</tt>,
<tt>#highest_object_number</tt>,
<tt>#lowest_attribute_number</tt>,
<tt>#lowest_action_number</tt>,
<tt>#lowest_routine_number</tt>,
<tt>#lowest_array_number</tt>,
<tt>#lowest_constant_number</tt>,
<tt>#lowest_class_number</tt>,
<tt>#lowest_object_number</tt>, and
<tt>#lowest_property_number</tt>.
<li><p>Unicode characters can now be included in Glulx word arrays as literals, e.g.
<pre>
  Array text1 table "A @{1c4} A";
  Array text2 --> "A @oef A";
</pre>
<li><p>The new command line switch <tt><b>-V</b></tt> simply prints the version and date of the compiler and
then exits.
<li><p>The new setting <tt>$SERIAL</tt> sets the six digit serial number written into the header of the game,
e.g.
<pre>
  $SERIAL=160305
</pre>
</ul>
<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
Items of the form [Mantis N] quote the bug&rsquo;s reference number in Inform 7&rsquo;s Mantis bug tracker. 
<ul>
<li><p>It is no longer possible to cause values to be pushed onto the stack but not then pulled by evaluating
a logical expression but not assigning or using the result of that expression. [Mantis 509]
<li><p>The output for the <tt>$list</tt> command line argument now includes the value of the
<tt>$MAX_ARRAYS</tt> setting. [Mantis 1355]
<li><p>Memory settings can no longer overflow if set to very large values. These values are limited to a
maximum of 999999999: setting them higher just results in a warning. [Mantis 1356]
<li><p>The debugging output file now contains the correct function addresses even when the compiler has been
told to omit unused functions. [Mantis 1515]
<li><p>Crashes caused by over-long identifiers have been fixed. Note that as a result, the previously allowed
(although undocumented) use of strings or dictionary words in an action-based (implicit) switch statement
now causes an error. [Mantis 1696,1702]
<li><p>The object table is now always generated at an even Z-Machine address, as the logic in the veneer
routine <tt>RA__Pr()</tt> requires this. [Mantis 1712]
<li><p>The <b>F</b> and <b>u</b> options are now explicitly disallowed with the <tt>Switches</tt> directive.
[Mantis 1703]
<li><p>Assigning values to system functions now leads to an error message, rather than a crash. [Mantis 1704]
<li><p>Crashes due to over-long abbreviations have been fixed. [Mantis 1719]
</ul>

<h2>Compiler 6.33</h2>
These are the changes delivered in version 6.33 of the Inform compiler.
<h3>Features added</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Unused routines can now be detected and omitted from the compiled game, through two
new settings. If <tt>$WARN_UNUSED_ROUTINES</tt> is set to 1, unused routines (other than those in
the Inform library) are reported during compilation; if it is set to 2, unused routines anywhere,
even in the library, are reported. If <tt>$OMIT_UNUSED_ROUTINES</tt> is set to 1, unused routines
are omitted.
<li><p>A new command line switch <tt><b>-Cu</b></tt> can be used to specify that the source file
character set is UTF-8, allowing source files to contain Unicode characters beyond those defined in
ISO 8859-1 to 8859-9.
<li><p>A new <tt>#Undef</tt> directive will cause a previously defined constant to become undefined.
<li><p><tt>#Ifdef</tt> directives are now allowed within an object declaration.
<li><p>Action statements can have an optional extra &lsquo;actor&rsquo; argument, allowing action
statements of the form
<pre>
  &lt;Take pie, orc&gt;; ! simple form
  &lt;&lt;Look, floyd&gt;&gt;; ! auto-returning form
</pre>
Note that this also requires a library change to be useful.
<li><p>A previously declared routine can be renamed with a new form of the <tt>Replace</tt> directive.
For example, if a source file contained
<pre>
  Replace Banner OriginalBanner;
</pre>
It could then (after including the library) contain this definion of a function:
<pre>
  [ Banner;
    OriginalBanner();
    print "Extra version info!^";
  ];
</pre>
The library's banner code would then be in <tt>OriginalBanner()</tt>.
<li><p>The previously deprecated <tt>Dictionary</tt> directive can now have the following forms:
<pre>
  Dictionary 'word';
  Dictionary 'word' val1;
  Dictionary 'word' val1 val3;
</pre>
The first of these forms just adds the word to the dictionary, with all flags set to zero, if it is not
already in the dictionary. The second form also sets the <tt>dict_par1</tt> flag to the given value, or
bitwise-or&rsquo;s the value in if the word already exists. The third form also sets the <tt>dict_par3</tt>
in the same way as for <tt>dict_par1</tt>.
<p>
The values can be numeric literals or constants. They can be 0-255 for Z-code, or 0-65535 for Glulx.
<li><p>The &ldquo;<tt>font on</tt>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<tt>font off</tt>&rdquo; statements now call the
<tt>@set_font</tt> opcode for Z-code V5 and higher.
<li><p>The Glulx version of the <tt>Unsigned__Compare()</tt> veneer routine has been changed to a
more efficient implementation, using Glulx&rsquo;s unsigned comparison opcodes.
<li><p>The debugging output file, generated when the <tt><b>-k</b></tt> is used, has been changed to a
new, XML-based format.
<li><p>Two new Z-code settings have been added to support the extra words in the header extension table
specified in section 11.1.7 of the <i>Z-Machine Standards Document</i> version 1.1. <tt>$ZCODE_HEADER_EXT_WORDS</tt>
specifies how many extra words to add (so for all three words defined in the 1.1 standard, this would
be set to 3). <tt>$ZCODE_HEADER_FLAGS_3</tt> specifies the value to put in the first of these three words,
which is the "flags3" field.
<li><p>A new Glulx setting <tt>$GLULX_OBJECT_EXT_BYTES</tt> has been added, which specifies an
amount of additional space to add to each object record. The default is 0.
</ul>
<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
Items of the form [Mantis N] quote the bug&rsquo;s reference number in Inform 7&rsquo;s Mantis bug tracker. 
<ul>
<li><p>Function calls of the form <tt>f(g)(h)</tt> (that is, where <tt>f()</tt> returns the address of a
function that is called with <tt>h</tt> as its argument) are now compiled correctly: previously, such calls were
compiled as if the code was <tt>f(g(h))</tt>. [Mantis 510]
<li><p>The bounds checking related to internal arrays that are are sized from various compiler settings
has been improved, so that it should not be possible to crash the compiler if these settings are too small.
In addition, a start has been made on allowing the compiler to grow its internal buffers, rather than relying
on these settings to specify sufficient buffer sizes. [Mantis 601,603,610,614,758,842,844]
<li><p>The error message shown when too many global variables are declared now tells the user to
increase the <tt>$MAX_GLOBAL_VARIABLES</tt> setting. [Mantis 611]
<li><p>The setting <tt>$MAX_CLASS_TABLE_SIZE</tt>, which was not used anywhere, has been removed. [Mantis 612]
<li><p>The compiler no longer crashes if run with the <tt><b>-k</b></tt> switch and passed a source file
containing no routines at all. [Mantis 843]
<li><p>Floating-point constants in &ldquo;<tt>#Ifdef TARGET_GLULX;</tt>&rdquo; sections do not now cause an error
when compiling to Z-code. [Mantis 927]
<li><p>The error message produced if an action routine is not found for an action name has been improved to include
the action name, and a sensible line number. [Mantis 1014]
<li><p>The compiler is now better at not producing spurious additional errors after it has encountered a directive
that contains an error. [Mantis 1018,1035]
<li><p>The compiler no longer crashes when reporting errors after line 65,535 in long Inform 6 source files. [Mantis 1023]
<li><p>The compiler now reports a meaningful text compression rate when outputting statistics for Glulx with the
<tt>-Gs</tt> switches. [Mantis 1026]
<li><p>An error is now reported if a source file ends with an unterminated object definition. [Mantis 1036]
<li><p>The three argument form of the <tt>read</tt> statement no longer assumes that the routine passed as the
third argument to the statement will not change the global variable that the statement uses internally. [Mantis 1084]
<li><p>The 'Abbreviate' statement now works with words containing non-English characters. [Mantis 1130]
<li><p>Attempting to use <tt>@pop</tt> opcode for V5 or higher no longer results in a crash. [Mantis 1172]
<li><p>The Glulx setting <tt>$NUM_ATTR_BYTES</tt>, which determines the number of bytes in an object set aside
for attribute flags, now works correctly. Note that this has required a change to the veneer routines that conflicts
with the definition of <tt>FUNC_2_CP__Tab()</tt> in the &lsquo;Accelerated Functions&rsquo; section of the Glulx 3.1.2
specification. If you change this setting, you should take great care if you also use the Glulx accelerated functions
feature (as Inform 7 does by default). [Mantis 1197]
<li><p>The syntax of declaring a function so that it prints its name and arguments:
<pre>
  [ Whatever * x y;
    ! Whatever function logic ...
  ];
</pre>
is now supported for Glulx. [Mantis 1214]
<li><p>The statistics produced by the <tt>-s</tt> compiler switch are now correct for Glulx. [Mantis 1267]
</ul>

<h2>Compiler 6.32</h2>
These are the changes delivered in version 6.32 of the Inform compiler.
<h3>Features added</h3>
Items of the form [C63NNN] quote the feature&rsquo;s reference number in the &lsquo;Compiler&rsquo; section of the Inform 
Patch List. 
<ul>
<li><p>The Z-machine opcodes for pushing and pulling values from the stack are <tt>@push</tt> and <tt>@pull</tt>, used like this:
<pre>
  @push x;
  @pull x;
</pre>
However for Glulx the opcode syntax is different: instead the <tt>@copy</tt> opcode is used:
<pre>
  @copy x sp;
  @copy sp x;
</pre>
The compiler now supports the <tt>@push</tt> and <tt>@pull</tt> syntax under Glulx as an alias for <tt>@copy</tt>, allowing
the same code to be used for both the Z-machine and Glulx. [C63104]
<li><p>Custom Glulx opcodes (such as opcodes that post-date the compiler) can now be specified with the custom opcode syntax.
The format of this syntax is
<pre>  @"FlagsCount:Code"
</pre>
<tt><i>Flags</i></tt> (which are optional) can include &ldquo;S&rdquo; for store, &ldquo;SS&rdquo; for two stores, &ldquo;B&rdquo; for branch format,
or &ldquo;R&rdquo; if execution never continues after the opcode. <tt><i>Count</i></tt> is the number of arguments (currently limited to 0-9),
and <tt><i>Code</i></tt> is a decimal integer representing the opcode number.<p>
For example, <tt>@"S3:123"</tt> is the syntax for a three-argument opcode (load, load, store) whose opcode number in decimal
is 123, and <tt>@"2:234"</tt> is the syntax for a two-argument opcode (load, load) whose number is 234. [C63107]
<li><p>When compiling to Glulx, the Glulx format version number of the resulting story file is usually determined by which Glulx opcodes
are used in the source code. This version number can now be over-ridden by providing a <tt><b>-v</b></tt> command line argument after the
<tt><b>-G</b></tt> switch to select Glulx mode. For example, the arguments
<tt><b>-G -v3.1.0</b></tt> set the Glulx version number to &ldquo;3.1.0&rdquo;. [C63108]
<li><p>The Unicode related opcode added to the Glulx 3.0.0 specification, <tt>@streamunichar</tt>, is now supported.
<li><p>When compiling to Glulx, characters outside of the ISO 8859-1 range can now be used in strings. The maximum number of such
characters allowed is determined by a new memory setting, <tt>$MAX_UNICODE_CHARS</tt>.
<li><p>When compiling to Glulx, the syntax
<pre>  print (char) <i>value</i>;</pre>
now works for values greater than 255, printing the appropriate Unicode character. (For such values <tt>@streamunichar</tt> is used;
for those less than or equal to 255, <tt>@streamchar</tt> is used as before.)
<li><p>The memory heap related opcodes added to the Glulx 3.1.0 specification (that is,
<tt>@mzero</tt>, <tt>@mcopy</tt>, <tt>@malloc</tt> and <tt>@mfree</tt>) are now supported.
<li><p>The acceleration related opcodes added to the Glulx 3.1.1 specification (that is,
<tt>@accelfunc</tt> and <tt>@accelparam</tt>) are now supported. There is also a new syntax to get the address of a global variable
<tt><i>var</i></tt>, with the expression &ldquo;<tt>#g$<i>var</i></tt>&rdquo;: this is provided so that such addresses can be provided
to the <tt>@accelparam</tt> opcode.
<li><p>The floating point related opcodes added to the Glulx 3.1.2 specification (that is,
<tt>@numtof</tt>, <tt>@ftonumz</tt>, <tt>@ftonumn</tt>, <tt>@ceil</tt>, <tt>@floor</tt>, <tt>@fadd</tt>, <tt>@fsub</tt>, <tt>@fmul</tt>, 
<tt>@fdiv</tt>, <tt>@fmod</tt>, <tt>@sqrt</tt>, <tt>@exp</tt>, <tt>@log</tt>, <tt>@pow</tt>, <tt>@sin</tt>, <tt>@cos</tt>, <tt>@tan</tt>, 
<tt>@asin</tt>, <tt>@acos</tt>, <tt>@atan</tt>, <tt>@atan2</tt>, <tt>@jfeq</tt>, <tt>@jfne</tt>, <tt>@jflt</tt>, <tt>@jfle</tt>, 
<tt>@jfgt</tt>, <tt>@jfge</tt>, <tt>@jisnan</tt> and <tt>@jisinf</tt>) are now supported.
<li><p>Floating point constants can be used in the Inform source code. Thes constants are expressed in the form &ldquo;$+1.0e+1&rdquo;:
that is, a dollar sign, followed by a plus or minus sign, followed by a floating point number, and then optionally a positive or negative
integer exponent. Inform does not attempt anything other than converting these constants to their 32-bit integer representation: there is
no constant folding as there is with integers, so the expression &ldquo;<tt>$+1.0 + $+1.0</tt>&rdquo; is not meaningful, and does not
produce the floating point value &ldquo;2.0&rdquo;.<p>
As an example of the use of these constants, the following adds together 100 and 123.45:
<pre>  @fadd $+100 $+1.2345e+2 result;</pre>
The compiler also defines the constants &ldquo;<tt>FLOAT_INFINITY</tt>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<tt>FLOAT_NINFINITY</tt>&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<tt>FLOAT_NAN</tt>&rdquo; for positive infinity, negative infinity and &ldquo;not a number&rdquo;, respectively.
<li><p>Glulx has a simple memory extension feature, where the game&rsquo;s header declares the memory space to be larger than the game file.
The extra space is filled out with zeroes when the game starts. This is now supported by a new option <tt>$MEMORY_MAP_EXTENSION</tt>.
This defaults to 0: if it is redefined to a larger value then the size of the game&rsquo;s memory space is extended by that amount.
<li><p>The number of verbs allowed by the compiler when compiling to Glulx is no longer limited to fewer than 256. As part of producing
the game file, the compiler creates a dictionary table that contains verb numbers. However, despite in Glulx there being space for a verb
number between 0 and 65535 in this table, only one byte of it (that is, values between 0 and 255) was used. This has been fixed.<p>
However, this also requires library changes to be useful, as the library makes use of this dictionary table. The library used by Inform 7
has been adjusted to take advantage of this, but the Inform 6/11 library has not.
<li><p>The dictionary of Glulx games can now contain characters outside of ISO 8859-1. There is a new
memory setting, <tt>$DICT_CHAR_SIZE</tt>: by default this is 1, but setting it to 4 causes the compiler to create a dictionary containing
32-bit Unicode characters.<p>
However, this also requires library changes to be useful, as the library makes use of this dictionary table.
</ul>
<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
Items of the form [C63NNN] quote the bug&rsquo;s reference number in the &lsquo;Compiler&rsquo; section of the Inform 
Patch List. 
<ul>
<li><p>Strict mode is no longer enabled by default when generating V3 and V4 Z-code files, as strict mode
makes use of opcodes that are V5+ only. [C63007] 
<li><p>The base unit of Inform&rsquo;s internal memory allocation for various structures (for example the buffer used
to hold the generated code) is no longer fixed: it is now controlled by a setting <tt>$ALLOC_CHUNK_SIZE</tt>.
This allows, for example, the maximum Glulx code size to be greater than 640Kb. [C63102] 
<li><p>When compiling to Glulx, the stack size of the resulting story file is no longer fixed at 4096: it can be changed
by the setting <tt>$MAX_STACK_SIZE</tt>. [C63108]
<li><p>The compiler could crash if the size of the grammar table exceeded the size of the Z-machine readable memory: this
is now fixed. [C63110]
<li><p>Creating a Z-code game file with precisely 64Kb of readable memory produced an invalid file. This is now prevented,
so that the largest readable memory size is 64Kb minus 2 bytes. [C63112]
<li><p>Previously, under Glulx the <tt>print_to_array()</tt> function could be called with either two arguments, specifying both
the array to print to and its length, or just one argument, the later matching what is allowed when compiling to Z-code. This
one argument form has now been withdrawn under Glulx as a security hole, and a source to problems with writing beyond the end
of the array: now the array length must be specified. (See also <a href="#FeaturesGlulx">Features available only in Glulx</a>.)
<li><p>Veneer routines are no longer excluded from Inform&rsquo;s assembly output (which is accessed with the <tt><b>-a</b></tt>
command line switch).
<li><p>For Linux and other Unix variants the default memory settings have been increased, which should remove the need
to change the compiler settings when building large projects on these platforms.
<li><p>For Mac OS X, the maximum length of a file path is now 8192 characters, which should prevent any further problems with
long paths on this platform.
</ul>

<h2>Compiler 6.31</h2>
These are the changes delivered in version 6.31 of the Inform compiler.
<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
Items of the form [C63NNN] quote the bug&rsquo;s reference number in the &lsquo;Compiler&rsquo; section of the Inform 
Patch List. 
<ul>
<li><p>When individual properties are read (successfully), there is no longer a futile attempt to look up 
the property index in the common property table. [C63016] 
<li><p>Complex <tt>if</tt> statements, of the form <tt>if (x == 1 or 3 or 5 ... or 99),</tt> now don&rsquo;t crash the 
compiler. [C63013] 
<li><p>The compiler is better at handling lengthy path names. [C63009] 
<li><p>Backpatching and other strange errors no longer occur if the code size of a V8 game exceeds 
256K. [C63005] 
<li><p>An Object or Class definition with more than 32 common property values now doesn&rsquo;t cause an 
internal compiler error. [C63001]
</ul>

<h2>Compiler 6.30</h2>
These are the changes delivered in version 6.30 of the Inform compiler.
<h3>Features added</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The compiler automatically defines a <tt>WORDSIZE</tt> constant, whose value is 2 when compiling for the 
Z-machine, and 4 when the target is Glulx. The constant specifies the number of bytes in a VM 
word, and we recommend that you use it in the small number of circumstances where this value is 
significant. The compiler also defines a constant <tt>TARGET_GLULX</tt> if you supply the <tt><b>-G</b></tt> switch, or 
<tt>TARGET_ZCODE</tt> otherwise; in both cases the constant value is 0. For more information on the use of 
these constants, see <a href="#Glulx">Support for Glulx</a>.
<li><p>The <tt>Switches</tt> directive, which enables certain compiler switches to be set from within the source 
file rather than on the compiler command line, has been superseded by a more powerful 
mechanism. The special comment characters &ldquo;!%&rdquo;, occurring on the very first line or lines of the 
source file, enable you to specify Inform Command Language (ICL) commands to control the 
compilation. For example:
<pre>
  !% -E1G                                    ! Glulx, 'Microsoft' errors 
  !% -~S                                     ! disable Strict mode 
  !% +include_path=./test,./,../lib/contrib  ! look in 'test' library 
  !% $MAX_STATIC_MEMORY=20000 
  Constant STORY "RUINS"; 
  ...
</pre>
ICL is described in &sect;39 of the <i>Inform Designer&rsquo;s Manual</i>. In brief: each line specifies a single 
command, starting with &ldquo;-&rdquo; to define one or more switches, &ldquo;+&rdquo; to define a path variable, or &ldquo;$&rdquo; to 
define a memory setting. Comments are introduced by &ldquo;$&rdquo;. The ICL command &ldquo;<tt>compile</tt>&rdquo; is not 
permitted at the head of a source file.
<li><p>Two new ICL memory settings are available; both of these could previously be changed only by 
rebuilding the compiler. <tt>$MAX_SOURCE_FILES</tt> has a default of 256, and <tt>$MAX_INCLUSION_DEPTH</tt> has a 
default value of 5.
<li><p>A new directive, similar to <tt>Array ... string</tt> and <tt>Array ... table</tt>, is provided:
<pre>
  Array array buffer N; 
  Array array buffer expr1 expr2 ... exprN; 
  Array array buffer "string";
</pre>
This creates a hybrid array of the form used by <tt><i>string</i>.print_to_array()</tt> and the new library 
routine <tt>PrintToBuffer()</tt>, in which the first <b>word</b> <tt><i>array</i>-->0</tt>
contains <tt><i>N</i></tt> and the following <tt><i>N</i></tt> <b>bytes</b>
<tt><i>array</i>->WORDSIZE</tt>, <tt><i>array</i>->(WORDSIZE+1)</tt> ... <tt><i>array</i>->(WORDSIZE+<i>N</i>-1)</tt> contain the specified 
expression values or string characters.
<li><p>A new <tt>(A)</tt> print rule &mdash; similar to the existing <tt>(The)</tt> &mdash; prints an object&rsquo;s indirect article with its first 
letter capitalised. The printed article is &ldquo;A&rdquo; or &ldquo;An&rdquo; by default, or else taken from the object&rsquo;s 
article property.
<li><p>The minimum size of the Z-code header extension table can be set using the command line switch 
<tt><b>-W</b><i>n</i></tt>. For example, <tt><b>-W6</b></tt> makes the table at least six words long.
<li><p>Source code in character sets other than ISO 8859-1 to 8859-9 is now supported, provided that the 
character set can be mapped onto one of the ISO 8859 sets.<p>
A mapping file is used to define how the source code is to be processed. This file consists of a 
directive indicating the ISO 8859 set to be mapped to, followed by 256 numbers giving the 
mapping. As an example, under Microsoft Windows, Russian text is encoded with the character 
set defined as Microsoft code page 1251. The following text defines a mapping to the ISO 8859-5 
set:
<pre>
  ! Windows Cyrillic (code page 1251) to ISO 8859-5

</pre>
Lines starting with &ldquo;!&rdquo; are treated as comments. The next line, beginning with &ldquo;C&rdquo;, defines the 
ISO set to map to in the same way as the <tt><b>-C</b><i>n</i></tt> command line switch.<p>
To use the mapping, Inform treats each character in the source file as a number between 0 and 
255, and uses that number as an index into the mapping table. For example, suppose that the 
character read in from a Russian Windows text file is the Cyrillic small letter &ldquo;ya&rdquo;.This character 
is represented in the Russian Windows character set by the number 255. Inform takes the 255th entry in 
the mapping, which is 239. Therefore the character is regarded as being 239 in ISO 8859-5.<p>
The name of the mapping file is specified by a new compiler path variable <tt>+charset_map</tt>. If the 
above mapping is held in a text file <tt>win1251.map</tt>, a Russian game could be compiled with a 
command line of the form:
<pre>
  inform +charset_map=win1251.map +language_name=Russian mygame.inf
</pre>
<li><p>The <tt>@check_unicode</tt> and <tt>@print_unicode</tt> opcodes, introduced in the <i>Z-Machine Standards 
Document</i> version 1.0, can now be called by name rather than by using the clumsier generic 
syntax <tt>@"EXT:11S"</tt> and <tt>@"EXT:12S"</tt>. For example:
<pre>
  @print_unicode $0401; ! Cyrillic capital letter IO
</pre>
<li><p>Strict mode (which compiles run-time integrity checks into your game) has been decoupled from 
Debug mode (which defines debugging verbs like TRACE and SHOWOBJ). This means that it&rsquo;s 
no longer necessary to turn off Strict checking (in order to disable the Debug verbs) before 
releasing a game, though of course you can do so if you wish to save space and increase 
performance. By default, Strict mode is <b>enabled</b> (turn it off with <tt><b>-~S</b></tt>) and Debug mode is 
<b>disabled</b> (turn it on with <tt><b>-D</b></tt>).
<li><p>The compiler now issues a warning if you use <tt><i>array->n</i></tt> on an array of words, or <tt><i>array-->n</i></tt> on an 
array of bytes. Use the new <tt>Array ... buffer</tt> directive to create a hybrid array which can be 
accessed without these warnings.
<li><p>The compiler also issues a warning if you refer to an unqualified property name within a routine, 
for example by typing <tt>(number==0)</tt> when you intended <tt>(self.number==0)</tt>.
<li><p>Another new warning appears if you include something other than a dictionary word in an 
object&rsquo;s <tt>name</tt> property. This is most commonly triggered if you try to add a single-letter word by 
typing <tt>name 'g' 'string'</tt> when you intended <tt>name 'g//' 'string'</tt>.
</ul>
<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
Items of the form [C62NNN] quote the bug&rsquo;s reference number in the &lsquo;Compiler&rsquo; section of the Inform 
Patch List. 
<ul>
<li><p>A problem with multiple assignment involving pointer arithmetic in Strict mode giving the wrong 
answer has been fixed. [C62127] 
<li><p>After using <tt>Extend only</tt> to separate off an element of an existing Verb definition, new synonyms 
for the separated verb now work correctly; previously they were applied to the residue of the 
original definition. [C62126] 
<li><p>Strict mode now tests for the use of <tt>@put_prop</tt> or <tt>@get_prop</tt> opcodes when a common property is 
longer than two bytes &mdash; the <i>Z-Machine Standards Document</i> says that this is illegal, and that the 
result is unspecified. The error message is of the form &ldquo;[** Programming error: <i>obj</i> (object 
number <i>N</i>) has a property <i>prop</i>, but it is longer than 2 bytes so you cannot use "." to read **]&rdquo;. This 
means that you have used the <tt><i>obj.prop</i></tt> construct in the situation where <tt><i>prop</i></tt> is a <b>common</b> 
property containing two or more values; typically <tt><i>prop</i></tt> is being explicitly used as an array, or it&rsquo;s 
an additive property and both <tt><i>obj</i></tt> and its parent class have defined values for it. The problem does 
not occur if <tt><i>prop</i></tt> is an individual property. [C62125] 
<li><p>Handling of European quotes is (finally) correct: the &ldquo;&laquo;&rdquo; symbol is produced by any of <tt>@&lt;&lt;</tt>, <tt>@@163</tt> 
and <tt>@{00AB}</tt>, while any of <tt>@>></tt>, <tt>@@162</tt> and <tt>@{00BB}</tt> produce the matching &ldquo;&raquo;&rdquo;. Note, however, that 
this problem originated in an error in the previous version of the <i>Z-Machine Standards Document</i>, 
and therefore older interpreters written to that specification, or more recent ones adjusted to work 
with the incorrect fix introduced at Inform 6.12, may still not give the correct results. [C62124] 
<li><p>The &ldquo;no such constant&rdquo; compilation error message now quotes the number of the appropriate 
source line. [C62123] 
<li><p>The <tt>metaclass()</tt> and <tt>ZRoutine()</tt> routines no longer report large unsigned values &mdash; above the 
game&rsquo;s Static memory area &mdash; as of type String. More usefully, the constant <tt>NULL</tt> (-1) is not 
reported as a String. [C62122] 
<li><p>Complex expressions combining a routine call and the <tt>ofclass</tt> and <tt>or</tt> operators no longer 
generate incorrect code. [C62121] 
<li><p>Negative constants in assembly operations &mdash; for example, <tt>@set_colour 4 (-1);</tt> &mdash; no longer cause 
the compiler to report an unexpected expression. [C62119] 
<li><p>Various problems with handling ISO 8859 characters in the range 128-255, and also in the use of 
@@ escape sequences, have been resolved. [C62117, C62115, C6211, C62003] 
<li><p>An <tt>Abbreviate</tt> directive containing a substring of &ldquo;&lt;unknown attribute&gt;&rdquo; may crash the 
compiler; hopefully, no more. [C62116]
<li><p>The 320Kb size limit placed by Inform on v6 and v7 games has been raised to 512Kb. [C62114] 
<li><p>Following a <tt>Zcharacter</tt> directive replacing the entire alphabet table, dictionary entries are no 
longer corrupted. [C62113] 
<li><p>The compiler now generates conditional branches spanning up to 63 bytes, lifting the previous 
unnecessary limit of a 31-byte span and leading to slightly shorter code. [C62112]
<li><p>Putting an object in itself doesn&rsquo;t now loop indefinitely. [C62110] 
<li><p>Various problems with the <tt>@store</tt>, <tt>@inc_chk</tt>, <tt>@dec_chk</tt>, <tt>@not</tt> and <tt>@je</tt> opcodes have been resolved. 
[C62109, C62108, C62105] 
<li><p>Problems with nested conditional compilation directives <tt>#Ifndef...#Ifnot...#Endif</tt> have been 
resolved. [C62107] 
<li><p>A long dictionary word &mdash; such as <tt>'elephants//p'</tt> &mdash; now correctly sets the plural bit. [C62103] 
<li><p>Problems with constant folding &mdash; that is, having the expression evaluated at compile-time &mdash; partly 
addressed in the previous bi-platform compiler, have been fixed. [C62102] 
<li><p>When compiling for Glulx, the compiler uses the <tt>@callf</tt>, <tt>@callfi</tt>, <tt>@callfii</tt> or <tt>@callfiii</tt> opcodes 
where applicable for generated calls instead of always pushing arguments onto the stack and 
using <tt>@call</tt>. 
<li><p>The presence of a <tt>Switches G;</tt> directive no longer causes the compiler to crash.
<li><p>An unexpected limit of 1024 labels per routine in the Z-machine assembly language generated by 
the compiler has been raised to 32768. The most likely way to encounter this limit is by creating a 
<tt>switch</tt> statement with an extremely large number of cases.
<li><p>A problem with the <tt>read</tt> statement generating the wrong opcode in a version 4 game has been 
corrected.
<li><p>A dynamic class declaration such as <tt>Class Pebble(NUM_PEBBLES) ... ;</tt> no longer creates a 
mysteriously large number of instances if <tt>NUM_PEBBLES</tt> isn&rsquo;t defined.
</ul>

<h2>Library 6/11</h2>
These are the changes delivered in version 6/11 of the Inform library.
<h3>Features added</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The library automatically defines four constants: <tt>LIBRARY_PARSER</tt> at the end of Parser.h, 
<tt>LIBRARY_VERBLIB</tt> at the end of VerbLib.h, <tt>LIBRARY_GRAMMAR</tt> at the end of Grammar.h, and 
<tt>LIBRARY_ENGLISH</tt> at the end of English.h. Contributed library extensions can use these constants to 
check that they have been Included in the correct location. A fifth constant <tt>LIBRARY_VERSION</tt>, 
currently defined as the number 611, can be checked by extensions which require this particular 
version of the library.
<li><p>The word &ldquo;wall&rdquo; has been removed from the <tt>CompassDirection</tt> objects defined in English.h, 
whose names are now simply &ldquo;north&rdquo;, &ldquo;south&rdquo;, etc.
<li><p>The verbs LOOK [TO THE] NORTH, LOOK DOWN, LOOK OUT[SIDE] etc &mdash; but not 
LOOK IN[SIDE], which is already available &mdash; have been added. By default, the response is of the 
form &ldquo;You see nothing unexpected ...&rdquo;, but you can change this for individual directions in 
individual rooms by providing a compass_look property:
<pre>
  Room   study "Your study" 
    with description "There is a doorway to the east of this austere room.", 
         compass_look [ obj; 
             if (obj == e_obj) "You see a doorway."; 
             if (obj == n_obj or s_obj or w_obj) "You see the wall."; 
         ], 
         e_to hallway; 
</pre>
This enhancement uses the mechanism described in
<a href="http://www.firthworks.com/roger/informfaq/ww.html#1">this topic in the Inform 6 FAQ</a>
(except that the <tt>compass_look</tt> property was previously named <tt>compasslook</tt>), and means that you 
no longer need to make the library changes described there.
<li><p>The verbs <tt>ASK <i>npc</i> TO <i>command</i></tt> and <tt>TELL <i>npc</i> TO <i>command</i></tt>
&mdash; both synomymous with <tt><i>npc,command</i></tt> &mdash; 
are provided. The new grammar is:
<pre>
  Verb 'ask' 
      ...
      * creature 'to' topic -> AskTo 
      ...
</pre>
in which the <tt>creature</tt> token matches the <tt><i>npc</i></tt> and the <tt>topic</tt> token represents
the <tt><i>command</i></tt>. <tt>AskTo</tt> isn&rsquo;t an action in the usual sense: it&rsquo;s trapped by the parser and
converted to the original <tt><i>npc,command</i></tt> format. The <tt><i>npc</i></tt> can intercept the
<tt><i>command</i></tt> by providing an <tt>orders</tt> property in the usual way &mdash;
see &sect;18 of the <i>Inform Designer&rsquo;s Manual</i>.<p>
This enhancement means that you may no longer require Irene Callaci&rsquo;s <tt>AskTellOrder.h</tt> library 
extension.
<li><p>The verbs RECORDING [ON|OFF] and REPLAY are now always available, irrespective of the 
DEBUG state. This may cause compilation errors if you have already defined these verbs 
yourself.
<li><p>The verbs PRY, PRISE, PRIZE and LEVER have been added. This may cause compilation errors 
if you have already defined these verbs yourself.
<li><p>The parser treats input lines beginning with &ldquo;*&rdquo; as a comment, without attempting any further 
parsing. The character used to introduce comments can be changed by defining 
<tt>COMMENT_CHARACTER</tt> before you <tt>Include Parser</tt>. For example:
<pre>  Constant COMMENT_CHARACTER '!';</pre>
Since comments are used primarily when capturing a transcript &mdash; either of a complete game 
(SCRIPT ON) or of input commands only (RECORDING ON) &mdash; the parser responds &ldquo;[Comment 
recorded]&rdquo; or &ldquo;[Comment NOT recorded]&rdquo; as appropriate.
<li><p>The <tt>selfobj</tt> object now includes an empty <tt>add_to_scope</tt> property, which you can over-ride with 
your own routine, typically to equip the player with body parts. For a single object:
<pre>  selfobj.add_to_scope = nose;</pre>
or for multiple objects:
<pre>
  [ IncludeBodyParts; PlaceInScope(nose); PlaceInScope(hands); ];
  selfobj.add_to_scope = IncludeBodyParts;
</pre>
<li><p>The task-based scoring system (&sect;22 of the <i>Inform Designer&rsquo;s Manual</i>) uses a byte array, which 
precludes the awarding of large or negative scores. To get round this, you can <tt>Replace</tt> the 
<tt>TaskScore()</tt> library routine as follows, and then define <tt>task_scores</tt> as a <b>word</b> array:
<pre>
  Replace TaskScore;
  Array task_scores --> 100 200 300 400 (-50) 600;
  [ TaskScore i; return task_scores-->i; ];
</pre>
<li><p>The scoring system is completely disabled if you define a constant <tt>NO_SCORE</tt> near the start of your 
game.
<pre>  Constant NO_SCORE;</pre>
<li><p>A new <tt>before_implicit</tt> property is available; at the moment this is used only by the parser, when 
it is about to perform an implicit TAKE (for example, EAT APPLE when you&rsquo;re not holding the 
apple). You can give this property to an object if you wish to control the parser&rsquo;s behaviour. The 
property&rsquo;s value should be a constant or a routine which returns: 0 to report &ldquo;(first taking the...)&rdquo; 
and then attempt to do so (this is what currently happens); 1 to attempt the TAKE without first 
issuing the message, 2 to proceed with the requested action without attempting the TAKE, or 3 to 
object that &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t holding that!&rdquo;. The object can test <tt>action_to_be</tt> to determine which action 
has triggered the TAKE:
<pre>
  before_implicit [;
    Take: if (action_to_be == ##Eat) return 2;
  ],
</pre>
<li><p>A new system variable <tt>sys_statusline_flag</tt> is set to 1 initially if you have used the 
<tt>statusline time;</tt> directive in your program to show a clock, and to 0 otherwise. It can be 
changed by the program.
<li><p>An object&rsquo;s <tt>invent</tt> property &mdash; if it has one &mdash; is now invoked both when displaying the player&rsquo;s 
inventory <b>and</b> when including the object in a room description. <tt>invent</tt> is invoked in the usual 
way (with <tt>inventory_stage</tt> first set to 1, and then set to 2) both when mentioning the object in a 
room description, and when listing it in the player&rsquo;s inventory. By default you&rsquo;ll get the same 
output each time. If you need to distinguish between the two occasions, you can test 
<tt>(c_style&amp;PARTINV_BIT)</tt> &mdash; true during a room description &mdash; or <tt>(c_style&amp;FULLINV_BIT)</tt> &mdash; true 
during an inventory. Here&rsquo;s an example:
<pre>
  Object  -> "sack" 
    with  name 'sack', 
          invent [; 
              ! When listing objects in the player's inventory 
              if (c_style&amp;FULLINV_BIT) rfalse; 

              ! When listing objects at the end of a room description 
              if (inventory_stage == 1) switch (children(self)) { 
                  0: print "an empty sack"; 
                  1: print "a sack containing ", (a) child(self); 
                  default: print "an assortment of objects in a sack"; 
                  } 
              rtrue; 
              ], 
    has   container open; 
</pre>
This enhancement uses the mechanism described in
<a href="http://www.firthworks.com/roger/informfaq/ww.html#4">this topic in the Inform 6 FAQ</a>
and means that you no longer need to <tt>Include WriteList</tt>.
<li><p>The <tt>turns</tt> counter is now initialised to 0, not 1. You can change this if you define a constant 
<tt>START_MOVE</tt> near the start of your game. 
<pre>  Constant START_MOVE 1;</pre>
<li><p>A new <tt>LibraryExtensions</tt> object is defined, whose function is to act as a parent to initialisation 
objects created by library extensions. These objects may provide <tt>ext_initialise</tt> and/or 
<tt>ext_messages</tt> property routines, whose role is to help integrate the extension into a game. This is 
best explained by example.<p>
Consider the <tt>SmartCantGo.h</tt> extension, which replaces &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go that way&rdquo; messages by the 
more informative &ldquo;You can go only north, south and east&rdquo;, and can be integrated into a game by 
adding a <tt>ChangeDefault(cant_go, SmartCantGo)</tt> statement to your <tt>Initialise()</tt> routine. Instead 
of requiring the author to make this addition, the extension could now cause it to happen 
automatically by defining an initialisation object as a child of <tt>LibraryExtensions</tt>, like this:
<pre>
  Object  "(SmartCantGo)" LibraryExtensions 
    with  ext_initialise [; ChangeDefault(cant_go, SmartCantGo); ];
</pre>
Just before calling the game&rsquo;s <tt>Initialise()</tt> routine, the library loops through the children &mdash; if any 
&mdash; of <tt>LibraryExtensions</tt>, and executes those <tt>ext_initialise</tt> properties that it finds there. The 
property routines can perform any appropriate setup processing that would otherwise have to be 
inserted into the <tt>Initialise()</tt> routine itself; for example, starting a daemon running.<p>
A similar process takes place when displaying library messages. The library first checks whether 
the author has provided a <tt>LibraryMessages</tt> object to intercept the message which it is about to 
display. If not, it now loops through the children of <tt>LibraryExtensions</tt>, and executes 
<tt>ext_messages</tt> properties that it finds there. If none of those routines returns true to signal that the 
message has been dealt with, the standard library text is then printed in the usual way. For
example, here&rsquo;s how an extension might automatically intercept Inventory messages (unless the 
game has already handled them via <tt>LibraryMessages</tt>):
<pre>
  Object  "(someInventoryExtension)" LibraryExtensions 
    with  ext_messages [;
              Inv: switch(lm_n) {
                1: "You are empty-handed.";
                2: "Your possessions include";
              } 
          ];
</pre>
Note that this is an experimental feature, and may be modified or extended in the light of 
experience.
</ul>
<h3>Library routines</h3>
Several new library routines are provided to harmonise commonly-encountered differences between 
the Z-machine and Glulx VMs (see also <a href="#LibraryGlulx">Library routines available only in Glulx</a>).
<p><tt>KeyCharPrimitive()</tt>
<p><blockquote>waits for a single key, and returns the character from 1-255 (or, for Glulx, one of the Glk special 
key codes.). For Glulx only, an extended form is available &mdash;
see <a href="#LibraryGlulx">Library routines available only in Glulx</a>.</blockquote>
<p><tt>KeyDelay(<i>time</i>)</tt>
<p><blockquote>waits <tt><i>time</i></tt> tenths of a second for a single key. If no key is pressed within that period it returns 
zero; otherwise it returns the character from 1-255.</blockquote>
<p><tt>ClearScreen()<br>
ClearScreen(<i>selector</i>)</tt>
<p><blockquote><tt>ClearScreen()</tt> clears both the status line and the main window. The cursor moves to the top of the 
screen. The routine should be followed by a call to <tt>MoveCursor()</tt> or <tt>MainWindow()</tt>. Alternatively, 
using <tt>ClearScreen(<i>selector</i>)</tt>: if <tt><i>selector</i></tt> is 0, both are cleared; if <tt><i>selector</i></tt> is 1 only the 
status line is cleared; if <tt><i>selector</i></tt> is 2 only the main window is cleared.</blockquote>
<p><tt>MoveCursor()<br>
MoveCursor(<i>line</i>, <i>column</i>)</tt>
<p><blockquote><tt>MoveCursor()</tt> selects the status line for output. <tt>MoveCursor(<i>line</i>, <i>column</i>)</tt> selects the status line 
for output and moves the cursor to the given <tt><i>line</i></tt> and <tt><i>column</i></tt> within the status area, where line 1 
is the top line and column 1 is the far left. (This is necessary because the Glk convention is to 
number both lines and columns from 0 rather than 1.)</blockquote>
<p><tt>MainWindow()</tt>
<p><blockquote>selects the main (buffered) text window for output.</blockquote>
<p><tt>StatusLineHeight(<i>lines</i>)</tt>
<p><blockquote>sets the height of the status line in lines. The standard <tt>DrawStatusLine()</tt> calls this every turn, 
which isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, since <tt>StatusLineHeight()</tt> is smart. If you replace <tt>DrawStatusLine()</tt>, 
maintain this convention. (The library menu routines fiddle with the status line, and it&rsquo;s up to 
<tt>DrawStatusLine()</tt> to reset it after the menus are over.)<p>
A new library variable <tt>gg_statuswin_cursize</tt> holds the current setting (in both VMs).</blockquote>
<p><tt>ScreenWidth()</tt>
<p><blockquote>returns the number of characters that can be printed in a monospaced font between the left and 
right borders of the currently selected window. For Glulx only, the extended form 
<tt>ScreenWidth(<i>win</i>)</tt> works on a specified window id; note that the results are unreliable if the 
normal style for that window uses a proportional font.</blockquote>
<p><tt>ScreenHeight()</tt>
<p><blockquote>returns the height in lines of the main window.</blockquote>
<p><tt>SetColour(<i>fg</i>, <i>bg</i>)<br>
SetColour(<i>fg</i>, <i>bg</i>, <i>selector</i>)</tt>
<p><blockquote><tt>SetColour(<i>fg</i>, <i>bg</i>)</tt> sets the current foreground and background text colours, using the same codes 
as the <tt>@set_colour</tt> opcode in the Z-machine (1=default, 2=black, 3=red, 4=green etc.). Using 
<tt>SetColour(<i>fg</i>, <i>bg</i>, <i>selector</i>)</tt>, colours can be set separately in each window: if <tt><i>selector</i></tt> is 0, 
both are set (the top window will have inverted colours for the Z-machine); if <tt><i>selector</i></tt> is 1 only 
the status line is affected; if <tt><i>selector</i></tt> is 2 only the main window is affected.<p>
All colour functions are effective only if the library variable <tt>clr_on</tt> is set to non-zero.<p>
The advantage over <tt>@set_colour</tt> is that when the player restores a saved game or types UNDO, 
the colours will be correct for that state of the game.<p>
For Glulx, the routine produces an appropriate effect if style hints are enabled by the interpreter; it 
also clears the screen. For the Z-machine, a separate call to <tt>ClearScreen()</tt> is required.<p>
These associated constants are now provided for use with <tt>SetColour()</tt>; the final three are useful 
also with <tt>ClearScreen()</tt>:
<pre>

<h3>Bugs fixed</h3>
Items of the form [L610NN] quote the bug&rsquo;s reference number in the &lsquo;Library&rsquo; section of the Inform 
Patch List.
<ul>
<li><p>A command like EMPTY ME no longer replies &ldquo;yourself can't contain things&rdquo;. [L61036] 
<li><p>The commands TAKE ALL FROM X and REMOVE ALL FROM X, where X is a closed or 
empty container, now produce sensible messages rather than &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see any such thing&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t use multiple objects with that verb&rdquo; respectively. [L61035] 
<li><p>A problem with the misbehaviour of <tt>name</tt> properties on rooms, in conjunction with THE, has been 
corrected. [L61034] 
<li><p>The command PUT X INTO X now correctly produces &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t put something inside itself&rdquo;, 
rather than &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see any such thing&rdquo;. [L61033] 
<li><p>Run-time errors resulting from <tt>IndirectlyContains()</tt> attempting to find the parent of a Class 
which supports dynamic creation of objects have been resolved. [L61032] 
<li><p>Code in <tt>Parser__parse()</tt> which deals with looking ahead to the indirect object in cases like PUT 
ALL INTO BAG (a MULTIEXCEPT token) and TAKE ALL FROM BAG (a MULTIINSIDE 
token) now correctly sets the <tt>advance_warning</tt> global (to BAG). [L61031, L61023] 
<li><p>The <i>Inform Designer&rsquo;s Manual</i> (p. 98) states that SHOWOBJ should accept an object number; 
now it does. [L61030] 
<li><p>The <tt>YesOrNo()</tt> routine now re-prompts correctly after garbage input. [L61029] 
<li><p>The parse buffer is no longer declared and initialised incorrectly (albeit harmlessly). [L61028, 
L60708] 
<li><p>The <i>Inform Designer&rsquo;s Manual</i> (p. 93) defines the calling order of routines and properties for the 
&lsquo;Before&rsquo; stage as follows:<p>
<ol><li> <tt>GamePreRoutine()</tt>
<li> <tt>orders</tt> of the player 
<li> <tt>react_before</tt> of every object in scope 
<li> <tt>before</tt> of the current room 
<li> <tt>before</tt> of the first noun, if specified</ol><p>
In the library, however, steps 3 and 4 are executed in reverse order. They are now as documented. 
[L61027] 
<li><p> A <tt>found_in</tt> floating object which the player is able to take (probably due to a coding error) is no 
longer silently dropped when the player returns to one of the listed rooms. [L61026] 
<li><p>A small problem with inherited <tt>describe</tt> properties has been corrected. [L61025] 
<li><p>Standard screen-handling is now implemented in v6 games. [L61022] 
<li><p>The handling of &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go that way&rdquo; messages is made consistent. Also, the statement 
<tt>ChangeDefault(cant_go,myRoutine);</tt> now works. [L61020] 
<li><p>Attempting to place an object in/on an object where it is already now results in &ldquo;It&rsquo;s already 
there&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;You need to be holding it before you can put it into something else&rdquo;. [L61019] 
<li><p>A problem with misleading inventory listing has been clarified. [L61018]
<li><p>The command LEAVE X now correctly produces &ldquo;But you aren&rsquo;t in/on the X&rdquo;, if appropriate. 
[L61017] 
<li><p>The response to READ was inappropriate when an object is misspelled or out of scope. [L61016] 
<li><p>A small bug in the choice of library messages for PUSH and TURN, which wasn&rsquo;t noticeable 
unless you overrode the messages to be different from PULL, has been corrected. [L61015] 
<li><p>If you are in a dark room, you cannot examine what you are holding. Yet if you open a container 
you brought in from a lit room, the standard message &ldquo;You open the box, revealing a...&rdquo; was not 
being suppressed. [L61014] 
<li><p>The <tt>ScoreMatchL()</tt> routine in Parserm.h incorrectly decided which objects meet descriptors. As a 
result, some objects that didn&rsquo;t meet descriptors were not properly removed from the match list 
when the library is deciding which objects best match a player&rsquo;s input. [L61013] 
<li><p>The Infix problem parsing commands containing commas and periods has been fixed. 
[L61010] 
<li><p>A problem when describing what&rsquo;s visible after opening a container has been corrected. [L61009] 
<li><p>An inappropriate message after GO NORTH CIRCULAR has been corrected. [L61008] 
<li><p>Modified foreground and background colours are now correct after RESTORE and UNDO. 
[L61007] 
<li><p>The <tt>grammar</tt> property now works with a large game whose dictionary lies above $8000. [L61006] 
<li><p>A buffer conflict with disambiguation and UNDO has been resolved. [L61004] 
<li><p>If a player is inside a closed, non-transparent container, the library prints an extra blank line 
between the header &ldquo;The container&rdquo; and the first <tt>inside_description</tt> line it prints. No more. 
[L61002] 
<li><p>The list writing routines do not handle plural containers correctly. If you have two empty boxes, it 
might list &ldquo;two boxes (which is closed)&rdquo;. Not only should it say &ldquo;are closed&rdquo;, but it will lump 
empty containers together even if some are open and others aren&rsquo;t. Now resolved. [L61001] 
<li><p>A conflict between <tt>DrawStatusLine()</tt> and <tt>DisplayStatus()</tt> on how to determine whether to 
display turns or time is settled in favour of checking a header flag. [L60709]
</ul>

<h2><a name="Glulx">Support for Glulx</a></h2>
One of the limitations of the Z-machine is the size of the largest game that it supports: 256Kb if you 
compile a version 5 game, or 512Kb if you compile for version 8. If you find yourself up against this 
limit and you&rsquo;ve tried all the standard tricks to save a few bytes here and there, then it&rsquo;s time to switch 
to Glulx. That&rsquo;s easy to do: you just supply the <tt><b>-G</b></tt> compiler switch, the compiler generates Glulx code, 
and any Glulx interpreter will be able to run it.<p>
Actually, it isn&rsquo;t always quite that simple...
<h3><a name="KnowingWhich">Knowing which is which</a></h3>
As mentioned earlier, the compiler automatically defines a couple of useful constants. If you&rsquo;re 
compiling for the Z-machine then <tt>TARGET_ZCODE</tt> is defined; if you&rsquo;re compiling for Glulx then you&rsquo;re 
given <tt>TARGET_GLULX</tt> instead. You can use these with the <tt>Ifdef</tt> directive, like this:
<pre>
  #Ifdef TARGET_ZCODE; 
  ! Z-machine code here 
  #Endif;
  #Ifdef TARGET_GLULX; 
  ! Equivalent Glulx code here 
  #Endif; 
</pre>or more commonly like this:<pre>
  #Ifdef TARGET_ZCODE; 
  ! Z-machine code here 
  #Ifnot;
  ! Equivalent Glulx code here 
  #Endif; 
</pre>You&rsquo;ll find a lot of this if you look in the library files, but it&rsquo;s less frequently needed in a source file.
<h3>Glulx differences</h3>
The two VMs are not identical, and you need to be aware of their differences.
<h4>Word size</h4>
The most basic difference between Glulx and the Z-machine is that words are four bytes long instead 
of two. All Glulx variables are 32-bit values, the stack contains 32-bit values, property entries are 
32-bit values, and so on.<p>
In most Inform programming, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about this change at all. For example, if you 
have an array 
<pre>  Array mylist --> 10;</pre>
...then Z-code Inform allocates ten words &mdash; that is, twenty bytes &mdash; and you can access these values as 
<tt>mylist-->0</tt> through <tt>mylist-->9</tt>. If you compile the same code under Glulx Inform, the compiler again 
allocates ten words &mdash; now forty bytes &mdash; and you can still access them as <tt>mylist-->0</tt> through
<tt>mylist-->9</tt>. Everything works the same, except that the array can contain values greater than the 
Z-machine&rsquo;s limit of 65535.<p>
<tt>Table</tt> arrays also refer to two- or four-byte word values, and the first word is the length of the array. 
<tt>String</tt> and <tt>-></tt> arrays, and the <tt>-></tt> notation, still refer to single bytes. You should not have to modify 
your code here, either.<p>
There are two important cases where you <b>will</b> have to modify your code. First is the <tt>.#</tt> operator. The 
expression <tt><i>obj</i>.#<i>prop</i></tt> returns the length of the property <b>in bytes</b>. Since properties almost always 
contain words rather than bytes, it is very common to have Z-machine code like:
<pre>
  len = (obj.#prop) / 2; 
  for (i=0 : i&lt;len : i++) 
      print (string) (obj.&amp;prop)-->i; 
</pre>
In Glulx Inform programs, it is necessary to divide by 4 instead of by 2, so you should replace the 
above code with:
<pre>
  len = (obj.#prop) / WORDSIZE; 
  for (i=0 : i&lt;len : i++) 
   print (string) (obj.&amp;prop)-->i; 
</pre>
This will compile and run correctly in both VMs. <p>
The other circumstance where your code may need modifying in this manner is when using the &lsquo;print 
to array&rsquo; feature. Code like this:
<pre>
  Array mybuf buffer 100; ! must be big enough for largest string you'll print 
  mystr = "hello"; 
  mystr.print_to_array(mybuf);
</pre>
results in the first <b>word</b> of <tt>mybuf</tt> containing 5 (the number of characters in <tt>mystr</tt>), and the following 
five <b>bytes</b> containing &lsquo;h&rsquo;, &lsquo;e&rsquo;, &lsquo;l&rsquo;, &lsquo;l&rsquo; and &lsquo;o&rsquo;.
In the Z-machine, you could then output the characters from the array with either of these code fragments:
<pre>
  len = 2 + mybuf-->0 
  for (i=2 : i&lt;len : i++)
   print (char) mybuf->i; 

  len = mybuf-->0 
  for (i=0 : i&lt;len : i++)
   print (char) mybuf->(i+2);
</pre>
Again, you can make the code safe for both VMs if you change &ldquo;<tt>2</tt>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<tt>WORDSIZE</tt>&rdquo;:
<pre>
  len = WORDSIZE + mybuf-->0 
  for (i=WORDSIZE : i&lt;len : i++)
   print (char) mybuf->i; 

  len = mybuf-->0 
  for (i=0 : i&lt;len : i++)
   print (char) mybuf->(i+WORDSIZE);
</pre>
See also <a href="#FeaturesGlulx">Features available only in Glulx</a> for details of <tt>print_to_array</tt> under Glulx.
<h4>Directives</h4>
Glulx handles the majority of Inform directives, with two exceptions:
<ul>
<li><p>The <tt>Zcharacter</tt> directive causes a compilation error, since Glulx does not use the ZSCII character set.
Your best approach is to bypass the directive when compiling for Glulx:
<pre>
  #Ifdef TARGET_ZCODE; 
  Zcharacter ... ; 
  #Endif;
</pre>
<li><p>The (obsolete) <tt>Lowstring</tt> directive causes a run-time error when used like this:
<pre>
  Lowstring mystr "hello"; 

  string 0 mystr; 
  print "@00 and goodbye.";
</pre>
This simpler form, avoiding the use of <tt>Lowstring</tt>, works successfully:
<pre>
  string 0 "hello"; 
  print "@00 and goodbye.";
</pre>
See also <a href="#FeaturesGlulx">Features available only in Glulx</a> for additional printing variable support.
</ul>
<h4>Statements</h4>
Glulx handles the majority of Inform statements, with a few exceptions. If you try to use any of these 
statements in Glulx, you will cause a compilation error:
<ul>
<li><p><tt>save, restore</tt>: These are more complicated procedures in Glulx than in Z-code, and cannot be 
implemented without involving library variables and routines. If you want to do this sort of thing, 
modify or copy the library <tt>SaveSub()</tt> and <tt>RestoreSub()</tt> routines.
<li><p><tt>read</tt>: Similarly, reading a line of text in Glulx involves the library; the compiler cannot generate 
stand-alone code to do it. See instead the library <tt>KeyboardPrimitive()</tt> routine.
<li><p><tt>@<i>opcode</i></tt>: The Z-machine assembly language is completely different from that of Glulx. If you 
have used any assembly instructions, you will need to conceal them when compiling for Glulx, as 
described in <a href="#KnowingWhich">Knowing which is which</a>. See also
<a href="#FeaturesGlulx">Features available only in Glulx</a> for details of the <tt>glk()</tt> function call.
</ul>
Glulx now supports the Inform <tt>style</tt> statement, mapping the Z-machine forms onto Glk styles:
<blockquote><table width="80%" cellpadding="6pt" border="1" bordercolor="black" frame="hsides" rules="groups">
<thead>
<tr><td width="30%"><b>Inform statement</b></td><td><b>Equivalent Glk style</b></td></tr>
</thead>
<tr><td><tt>style roman;</tt></td><td><tt>style_Normal</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>style reverse;</tt></td><td><tt>style_Alert</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>style bold;</tt></td><td><tt>style_Subheader</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>style underline;</tt></td><td><tt>style_Emphasized</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>style fixed;</tt></td><td><tt>style_Preformatted</tt></td></tr>
</table></blockquote>
However, it is important to remember that, with Glulx, the appearance of a game is under the player&rsquo;s 
control &mdash; Glulx interpreters enable the font parameters associated with each style to be specified 
at run-time. Therefore, you should use styles with caution, and if necessary alert the player to the 
settings which your game expects. 
<h4>Character handling</h4>
Unlike the Z-machine, which internally uses the ZSCII character set (see the <i>Inform Designer&rsquo;s 
Manual</i> Table 2 on p. 519), Glulx uses strings consisting of either 8-bit characters in the ISO
8859-1 (Latin-1) encoding (which is the same as ZSCII for character values 0-127, but different for
character values 128-255), or 32-bit Unicode characters. In general you don't need to worry about
which string representation is used: the compiler will figure it out for you. The impact is as follows:
<ul>
<li><p><tt>@<i>escape_sequence</i></tt>: Escape sequences such as <tt>@:a</tt> and <tt>@LL</tt>
(for &ldquo;&auml;&rdquo; and &ldquo;&pound;&rdquo; respectively) are accepted identically by both VMs.
<li><p><tt>@@<i>decnum</i></tt>: The number is the character&rsquo;s internal decimal value, so <tt>@@65</tt>
is &ldquo;A&rdquo; in both VMs, but <tt>@@165</tt> is &ldquo;&iuml;&rdquo; in the Z-machine and &ldquo;&yen;&rdquo; in Glulx.
<li><p><tt>@{<i>hexnum</i>}</tt>: The number is the character&rsquo;s Unicode value, so <tt>@{41}</tt> is &ldquo;A&rdquo;
and <tt>@{EF}</tt> is &ldquo;&iuml;&rdquo; in both VMs. However, <tt>@{A5}</tt> is &ldquo;&yen;&rdquo; in Glulx,
but causes a Z-machine compilation error because &ldquo;&yen;&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a ZSCII character.
<li><p><tt>-C<i>n</i></tt>: The compiler switches <tt><b>-C1</b></tt> through <tt><b>-C9</b></tt>
specify that the source file uses the character set 
defined by ISO 8859-1 through 8859-9 respectively. In the Z-machine, the switch also initialises 
the higher ZSCII character set to appropriate values; this later feature is irrelevant when compiling for 
Glulx.
<li><p>Dictionaries in Glulx Inform 6 games have to consist of only ISO 8859-1 characters at present. This is
being worked on, and the necessary compiler changes have been made, but further library work is still needed.
</ul>
<h4>Compiler switches</h4>
We&rsquo;ve already mentioned the <tt><b>-G</b></tt> command line switch, which causes the compiler to output code 
for Glulx rather than for the Z-machine. There are a few other changes in this area (see the <i>Inform 
Designer&rsquo;s Manual</i> Table 3 on p. 521). 
<blockquote><table width="80%" cellpadding="6pt" border="1" bordercolor="black" frame="hsides" rules="groups">
<thead>
<tr><td width="10%"><b>Switch</b></td><td width="10%"><b>To</b></td><td><b>Meaning</b></td></tr>
</thead>
<tr><td><tt>-k</tt></td><td>off/on</td><td>incompatible with <tt>-G</tt> (output debugging information)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>-v*</tt></td><td>3 to 8</td><td>incompatible with <tt>-G</tt> (set Z-machine Version)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>-G</tt></td><td>off/on</td><td>compile for Glulx VM</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>-H</tt></td><td>off/on</td><td>use Huffman compression on Glulx strings (on by default)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>-X</tt></td><td>off/on</td><td>incompatible with <tt>-G</tt> (include Infix debugger)</td></tr>
</table></blockquote>
<h3>Glulx additions</h3>
Glulx offers some additional capabilities above those of the Z-machine:
<h4><a name="FeaturesGlulx">Features available only in Glulx</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>For Glulx, <tt>print_to_array</tt> function requires two arguments, the first being the array to print to,
and the second the length of that array:
<pre>  <i>len</i> = <i>mystr</i>.print_to_array(<i>mybuf</i>, 80);</pre>
This example writes no more than 76 characters into the array. If <tt><i>mybuf</i></tt> is an 80-byte array, you 
can be sure it will not be overrun. (Do not try this with the second argument less than 4.)<p>
The value written into <tt>mybuf-->0</tt>, and the value returned, are <b>not</b> limited to the number of 
characters written; they represent the number of characters in the complete string. This means 
that:
<pre>  <i>len</i> = <i>mystr</i>.print_to_array(<i>mybuf</i>, 4);</pre>
is an ugly but perfectly legal way to find the length of a string. (And in this case, <tt>mybuf</tt> need only 
be four bytes long.)
<li><p>Z-code Inform supports 32 printing variables, <tt>@00</tt> to <tt>@31</tt>, which you can include in strings and 
then set with the statement:
<pre>  string <i>num</i> "<i>value</i>";</pre>
In Glulx, this limit is raised to 64. Furthermore, in Glulx you can set these variables to a 
stand-alone routine as well as a string:
<pre>
  [ <i>routine</i>; print "<i>value</i>"; ]; 

  string <i>num routine</i>;
</pre>
In this case, the routine is called with no arguments and the result discarded; you should print your 
desired output inside the routine. <p>
In Glulx, unlike Z-code, a printing variable string can itself contain <tt>@..</tt> codes, allowing recursion. 
You can nest this as deeply as you want. However, it is obviously a bad idea to cause an infinite 
recursion. For example, this will certainly crash the interpreter:
<pre>
  string 3 "This is a @03!"; 
  print "What is @03?"; 
</pre>
<li><p>Many of the things that used to be Z-code assembly are now handled by Glk function calls. 
Making a Glk function call from Inform is slightly awkward, but not difficult.<p>
All of Glk is handled by the built-in Inform function <tt>glk()</tt>, which takes one or more arguments. 
The first argument is an integer; this tells <b>which</b> Glk call in being invoked. The remaining 
arguments are just the arguments to the Glk call, in order.<p>
Say, for example, that you want to set the text style to &ldquo;preformatted&rdquo;. The Inform code to 
accomplish this is: 
<pre>  glk($0086, 2);</pre>
The hex value $0086 means <tt>glk_set_style</tt>; the value &ldquo;2&rdquo; means <tt>Preformatted</tt>.<p>
The table of Glk calls, and the integers that refer to them, is given in Section 12.1.6 of the Glk specification
(remember that the values given there are hexadecimal).
<p>
Since calls based on numeric codes are not very easy to read, we recommend that you download 
John Cater&rsquo;s <tt>infglk.h</tt> library header, which defines wrapper functions and constants. For 
example, you could achieve the same effect with this call:
<pre>  glk_set_style(style_Preformatted);</pre>
When you read the Glk specification, bear in mind that the <tt>NULL</tt> value it talks about is the C 
language <tt>NULL</tt> (0), not the Inform Library <tt>NULL</tt> (-1). <tt>infglk.h</tt> defines a constant <tt>GLK_NULL</tt> (equal 
to 0) which you can use where appropriate.
<li><p>By default, arguments to routines work the same in Glulx as they do in Z-code. When you call a 
routine, the arguments that you pass are written into the routine&rsquo;s local variables, in order. If you 
pass too many arguments, the extras are discarded; too few, and the unused local variables are 
filled with zeroes.<p>
However, the Glulx VM supports a second style of routine. You can define a routine of this type 
by naming the first argument <tt>_vararg_count</tt>. For example:
<pre>
  [ StackFunc _vararg_count ix pos len; 
      !   <i>Glulx code here</i>
  ];
</pre>
If you do this, the routine arguments are <b>not</b> written into the local variables. Instead, they are 
pushed onto the stack, and you must use Glulx assembly to pull them off. All the local variables 
are initialized to zero, except for <tt>_vararg_count</tt>, which (as you might expect) contains the number 
of arguments that were passed in.<p>
Note that <tt>_vararg_count</tt> is a normal local variable, aside from its useful initial value. You can 
assign to it, increment or decrement it, use it in expressions, and so on.<p>
Stack-argument routines are most useful if you want a routine with variable arguments, or if you 
want to write a wrapper that passes its arguments on to another routine.

default.) If <tt><i>nostat</i></tt> is nonzero, any window rearrangement event is returned immediately as value 
80000000 (instead of the default behavior, which is to call <tt>DrawStatusLine()</tt> and keep waiting.)</blockquote>
<p><tt>PrintAnything(<i>thingie</i>, ...);</tt>
<p><blockquote>In the Z-machine, strings and routines are &ldquo;packed&rdquo; addresses, dictionary words are normal 
addresses, and game objects are represented as sequential numbers from 1 to <tt>#top_object</tt>. These 
ranges overlap; a string, a dictionary word, and an object could conceivably all be represented by 
the same numeric value.<p>
In Glulx, all those things are represented by normal addresses, so different items will always have 
different values. Furthermore, the first byte found at the address is an identifier value, which 
specifies what kind of item the address contains.<p>
<tt>PrintAnything()</tt> prints any thingie &mdash; string, routine (with optional arguments), object, object 
property (with optional arguments), or dictionary word &mdash; known to the library.

Extra arguments after a <tt><i>string</i></tt> or dictionary <tt><i>word</i></tt> are safely ignored.
The (first) argument you pass in is always interpreted as a thingie reference, not as an integer. 
This is why none of the forms shown above print out an integer. However, you can get the same 
effect by calling
<pre>  PrintAnything(DecimalNumber, <i>num</i>);</pre>
...which is where the <tt>DecimalNumber()</tt> routine comes in handy. You can also, of course, use other 
library routines, and do tricks like
<pre>
  PrintAnything(EnglishNumber, <i>num</i>); 
  PrintAnything(DefArt, <i>obj</i>);
</pre>
None of this may seem very useful; after all, there are already ways to print all those things. But 
<tt>PrintAnything()</tt> is vital in implementing the following routine:</blockquote>
<p><tt>PrintAnyToArray(<i>array</i>, <i>arraylen</i>, <i>thingie</i>, ...);</tt>
<p><blockquote>This works the same way, except that instead of printing to the screen, the output is diverted to the 
given array.<p>
The first two arguments must be the array address and its maximum length. Up to that many 
characters will be written into the array; any extras will be silently discarded. This means that you 
do not have to worry about array overruns.<p>
The <tt>PrintAnyToArray()</tt> routine returns the number of characters generated. (This may be greater 
than the length of the array. It represents the entire text that was output, not the limited number 
written into the array.)<p>
It is safe to nest <tt>PrintAnyToArray()</tt> calls. That is, you can call <tt>PrintAnyToArray(<i>routine</i>)</tt>, where 
<tt><i>routine</i>()</tt> itself calls <tt>PrintAnyToArray()</tt>. (However, if they try to write to the <b>same array</b>, chaos 
will ensue.)<p>
It is legal for <tt><i>arraylen</i></tt> to be zero (in which case <tt><i>array</i></tt> is ignored, and may be zero as well.) This 
discards <b>all</b> of the output, and simply returns the number of characters generated. You can use this 
to find the length of anything &mdash; even a function call.</blockquote>
<h4>Entry points available only in Glulx</h4>
An entry point is a routine which you can provide in your code, or leave out; the library will call it if 
it&rsquo;s present, ignore it if not &mdash; see &sect;21 of the <i>Inform Designer&rsquo;s Manual</i>.<p>
The library has some entry points which aid in writing more complicated interfaces &mdash; games with 
sound, graphics, extra windows, and other fancy Glk tricks. If you&rsquo;re just writing a standard 
Infocom-style game, <b>you can ignore this section</b>.
<p><tt>HandleGlkEvent(<i>ev</i>, <i>context</i>, <i>abortres</i>)</tt>
<p><blockquote>This entry point is called every time a Glk event occurs. The event could indicate nearly anything: 
a line of input from the player, a window resize or redraw event, a clock tick, a mouse click, or so 
on.<p>
The library handles all the events necessary for a normal Infocom-style game. You need to supply 
a <tt>HandleGlkEvent()</tt> routine only if you want to add extra functionality. The <tt><i>ev</i></tt> argument is a 
four-word array which describes the event. <tt><i>ev</i>-->0</tt> is the type of the event; <tt><i>ev</i>-->1</tt> is the window 
involved (if relevant); and <tt><i>ev</i>-->2</tt> and <tt><i>ev</i>-->3</tt> are extra information.
The <tt><i>context</i></tt> argument is 0 if 
the event occurred during line input (normal commands, <tt>YesOrNo()</tt>, or some other use of the 
<tt>KeyboardPrimitive()</tt> library routine); 1 indicates that the event occurred during character input 
(any use of the <tt>KeyCharPrimitive()</tt> library routine). The <tt><i>abortres</i></tt> argument is used only if you 
want to cancel player input and force a particular result; see below.<p>
If you return 2 from <tt>HandleGlkEvent()</tt>, player input will immediately be aborted. Some additional 
code is also required:
<ul>
<li><p>If this was character input <tt>(<i>context</i>==1)</tt>, you must call the Glk <tt>cancel_char_event</tt> function, 
and then set <tt><i>abortres</i>-->0</tt> to the character you want returned. Then return 2; 
<tt>KeyCharPrimitive()</tt> will end and return the character, as if the player had hit it.
<li><p>If this was line input <tt>(<i>context</i>==0)</tt>, you must call the Glk <tt>cancel_line_event function</tt>. (You 
can pass an array argument to see what the player had typed so far.) Then, fill in the length of 
the input to be returned in <tt><i>abortres</i>-->0</tt>. If this is nonzero, write the input characters 
sequentially into the array starting at <tt><i>abortres</i>-->WORDSIZE</tt>, up to (but not including) 
<tt><i>abortres</i>-->(WORDSIZE+len)</tt>. Do not exceed 256 characters. Then return 2; 
<tt>KeyboardPrimitive()</tt> will end and return the line.
</ul>
If you return -1 from <tt>HandleGlkEvent()</tt>, player input will continue even after a keystroke (for 
character input) or after the enter key (for line input).
You must re-request input by calling <tt>request_char_input</tt> or <tt>request_line_input</tt>.
Any other return value from <tt>HandleGlkEvent()</tt> (a normal return, <tt>rfalse</tt>, or <tt>rtrue</tt>) will not affect 
the course of player input.</blockquote>
<p><tt>InitGlkWindow(<i>winrock</i>)</tt>
<p><blockquote>This entry point is called by the library when it sets up the standard windows: the story window, 
the status window, and (if you use quote boxes) the quote box window. The story and status 
windows are created when the game starts (before <tt>Initialise()</tt>). The quote window is created 
and destroyed as necessary.<p>
<tt>InitGlkWindow()</tt> is called in five phases: 
<ol>
<li><p>The library calls <tt>InitGlkWindow(0)</tt>. This occurs at the very beginning of execution, 
even before <tt>Initialise()</tt>. You can set up any situation you want. (However, remember 
that the story and status windows might already exist &mdash; for example, if the player has 
just typed RESTART.) This is a good time to set <tt>gg_statuswin_size</tt> to a value other 
than 1. Return 0 to proceed with the standard library window setup, or 1 if you&rsquo;ve 
created all the windows yourself.
<li><p>The library calls <tt>InitGlkWindow(GG_MAINWIN_ROCK)</tt>, before creating the story window. 
This is a good time to set up style hints for the story window. Return 0 to let the library 
create the window; return 1 if you have yourself created a window and stored it in 
<tt>gg_mainwin</tt>.
<li><p>The library calls <tt>InitGlkWindow(GG_STATUSWIN_ROCK)</tt>, before creating the status 
window. Again, return 0 to let the library do it; return 1 if you have created a window 
and stored it in <tt>gg_statuswin</tt>.
<li><p>The library calls <tt>InitGlkWindow(1)</tt>. This is the end of window setup; you can take this 
opportunity to open other windows. (Or you can do that in your <tt>Initialise()</tt> routine. 
It doesn&rsquo;t matter much.)
<li><p>The library calls <tt>InitGlkWindow(GG_QUOTEWIN_ROCK)</tt>, before creating the quote box 
window. This does not occur during game initialization; the quote box window is 
created during the game, whenever you print a quote, and destroyed one turn later. As 
usual, return 1 to indicate that you&rsquo;ve created a window in <tt>gg_quotewin</tt>. (The desired 
number of lines for the window can be found in <tt>gg_arguments-->0</tt>.)
</ol>
However you handle window initialization, remember that the library requires a <tt>gg_mainwin</tt>. If 
you don&rsquo;t create one, and don&rsquo;t allow the library to do so, the game will shut down. Contrariwise, 
the status window and quote windows are optional; the library can get along without them.</blockquote>
<p><tt>IdentifyGlkObject(<i>phase</i>, <i>type</i>, <i>ref</i>, <i>rock</i>)</tt>
<p><blockquote>This entry point is called by the library to let you know what Glk objects exist. You must supply 
this routine if you create any windows, filerefs, file streams, or sound channels beyond the 
standard library ones. (This is necessary because after a RESTORE, RESTART, or UNDO 
command, your global variables containing Glk objects will be wrong.)<p>
<tt>IdentifyGlkObject()</tt> is called in three phases:
<ol>
<li><p>The library calls <tt>IdentifyGlkObject()</tt> with <tt><i>phase</i>==0</tt>. You should set all your Glk 
object references to zero. 
<li><p>The library calls <tt>IdentifyGlkObject()</tt> with <tt><i>phase</i>==1</tt>. This occurs once for each 
window, stream, and fileref that the library doesn&rsquo;t recognize. (The library handles the 
two standard windows, and the files and streams that have to do with saving, 
transcripts, and command records. You only have to deal with objects that you create.) 
You should set whatever reference is appropriate to the object. For each object: <tt><i>type</i></tt>
will be 0, 1, 2 for windows, streams, filerefs respectively; <tt><i>ref</i></tt> will be the object 
reference; and <tt><i>rock</i></tt> will be the object&rsquo;s rock, by which you can recognize it.
<li><p>The library calls <tt>IdentifyGlkObject()</tt> with <tt><i>phase</i>==2</tt>. This occurs once, after all the 
other calls, and gives you a chance to recognize objects that aren&rsquo;t windows, streams, 
or filerefs. If you don&rsquo;t create any such objects, you can ignore that bit. But you should 
also take the opportunity to update all your Glk objects to the game state that was just 
started or restored. (For example, redraw graphics, or set the right background sounds 
playing.)

<h3><a name="Translate">Information for translators</a></h3>
The library is designed to be easily translatable, and there are currently versions available in French, 
German and several other languages. If you maintain one of these translations, the following 
information may be useful to you.
<h4>English.h</h4>
This is the &ldquo;language definition file&rdquo;, and in translation is replaced by <tt>French.h</tt>, <tt>German.h</tt>, etc. The 
following changes have been made:
<ul>
<li><p>Class <tt>CompassDirection</tt> and its objects have been extensively revised.
<li><p>Routine <tt>LanguageVerb()</tt> has been reworked.
<li><p>Routines <tt>LanguageVerbIsDebugging()</tt>, <tt>LanguageVerbLikesAdverb()</tt> and <tt>LanguageVerbMayBeName()</tt> 
have been added to isolate language-specific tests previously embedded in <tt>parserm.h</tt>.
<li><p>Constants <tt>YOU__TX</tt> and <tt>COMMA__TX</tt> have been added.
<li><p>Routine <tt>LanguageLM()</tt> has been sorted alphabetically.
<li><p>In that routine, <tt>CommandsOff</tt>, <tt>CommandsOn</tt> and <tt>CommandsRead</tt> have been added.
<li><p>Also in that routine, <tt>Exit</tt>, <tt>Inv</tt>, <tt>Look</tt>, <tt>Miscellany</tt>, <tt>Places</tt>,
<tt>Pronouns</tt> and <tt>Score</tt> have been extended, 
and <tt>Go</tt> has been modified.
<li><p>Constant <tt>LIBRARY_ENGLISH</tt> has been added. We suggest that translated versions instead define <tt>
LIBRARY_DUTCH</tt>, <tt>LIBRARY_FRENCH</tt>, <tt>LIBRARY_GERMAN</tt>, <tt>LIBRARY_ITALIAN</tt>, <tt>LIBRARY_SPANISH</tt>, <tt>
LIBRARY_SWEDISH</tt> etc, in case it becomes useful at some time to determine which language is in 
force.
</ul>
<h4>Grammar.h</h4>
This file contains grammars for English verbs like TAKE and DROP, and in translation is replaced 
by <tt>FrenchG.h</tt>, <tt>GermanG.h</tt>, etc. The following changes have been made:
<ul>
<li><p>The grammars have been sorted alphabetically.
<li><p>Verb definitions <tt>'recording'</tt> and <tt>'replay'</tt> are no longer conditional on DEBUG.
<li><p>Verb definitions <tt>'showobj'</tt>, <tt>'ask'</tt>, <tt>'exit'</tt>, <tt>'look'</tt> and <tt>'tell'</tt> have been extended.
<li><p>Verb definition <tt>'pry'</tt> <tt>'prise'</tt> etc has been added.
