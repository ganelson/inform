<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP1" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;1. Volume files. </b>Documentation source is written in UTF-8 encoded plain text files. Except
for the markup notations described below, these really are plain text,
using skipped lines as paragraph breaks, and tabs for indented quotations:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    This is a paragraph of some text, which</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">    extends over perhaps many lines. All of the</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">    standard letters are allowed:</span>

<span class="plain-syntax">        The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">        Jinxed wizards pluck ivy from my big quilt.</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">        Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.</span>

<span class="plain-syntax">    The second para begins here, after the</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">    skipped line.</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">Note that line breaks in quotations are respected, whereas in regular
paragraphs they are not, and are treated as ordinary white space.
Lines in quotations can be indented still further with more tabs, and
those margins are preserved.
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    For example:</span>

<span class="plain-syntax">        Instead of waiting when the prevailing wind is northwest:</span>

<span class="plain-syntax">            now the prevailing wind is east.</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">"Quotations", as this suggests, are often in fact code examples for some
programming language.
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP2" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;2.  </b>In general, plain text means just what it says. Raw HTML should not be
included in documentation; but the syntax &lt;b&gt;Bold&lt;/n&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Italic&lt;/i&gt; is
an exception.
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP3" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;3.  </b>Tables are formatted automatically whenever Indoc sees a pattern like this:
</p>

<span class="plain-syntax">        "Uranium"  "U"     92</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">The top line is the title for the table, and then tab-delimited columns follow.
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP4" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;4.  </b>Recall that volumes are divided into chapters, which are themselves divided
into sections. A line in the form:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    [Chapter: CHAPTERTITLE] SECTIONTITLE</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">begins a new chapter, and simultaneously begins its first section; the first
line of a volume file must be of this form. For example,
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    [Chapter: Things] Descriptions</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">When it's time for a new section within the same chapter, the simpler form:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    [x] SECTIONTITLE</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">is used. Note that although chapters and sections are both numbered, this
numbering is automatically applied by Indoc, and does not appear in the source.
</p>

<p class="commentary">The final paragraph of a section is allowed to take a special form:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    (See REFERENCE for PURPOSE.)</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">For example,
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    (See Text with substitutions for more on varying what is printed.)</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">Here, the <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">REFERENCE</span></span> "Text with substitutions" is to another section in
the volume, having that title. Indoc will make this into a suitable link
in the generated HTML.
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP5" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;5.  </b>When a paragraph begins with <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">{CONTEXT:}</span></span>, it is included in the
generated documentation only for targets which match this context. A
context can be just a symbol created by <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">declare:</span></span> in the instructions
file, so for example:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    {Linux:}The top secret DRM decoder ring is not included under Debian...</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">would be included only if the instruction <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">declare: Linux</span></span> had been made
for the current target.
</p>

<p class="commentary">Contexts can however be compound, using the unary operator <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">^</span></span> (negation),
the binary <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">+</span></span> (conjunction), and binary <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">,</span></span> (disjunction), which associate
in that order. The simplest case is
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    {^Linux:}The top secret DRM decoder ring is in the Goodies folder...</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">which is included if and only if <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">Linux</span></span> has not been declared. More elaborate
examples would be:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    {^alpha,beta+gamma:}</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">which is true if either <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">alpha</span></span> is undeclared, or if both <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">beta</span></span> and <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">gamma</span></span>
are declared; and
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    {^(alpha,beta)+gamma:}</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">    {^alpha+^beta+gamma:}</span>

declared.
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP6" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;6. Inform-specific markup. </b>A quotation beginning with <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">{*}</span></span> is given a "paste" button allowing its
content to be pasted into the Source pane of an Inform project &mdash; though
of course, only for forms of the documentation appearing inside the Inform
UI app: it would be meaningless elsewhere.
</p>

<p class="commentary">A quotation beginning with <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">{**}</span></span> is a continuation of the previous
paste-this-in quotation.
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP7" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;7.  </b>In Inform documentation, the formal specification of a phrase can be
marked as in this example:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    {defn ph_randomdesc}a/-- random (description of values) ... value</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">    This phrase makes a uniformly random choice...</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">    ...the result is the special value "nothing".</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">    {end}</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">The markers <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">{defn ph_randomdesc}</span></span> and <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">{end}</span></span>, which bookend the definition,
are invisible in the HTML output, but are used in the cross-referencing
material which Indoc produces for the benefit of Inform.
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP8" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;8.  </b>The Index pane, and problem messages, need to link into the documentation
inside the Inform app. We can prepare for this by tagging the opening line
of a section like so:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    [x] Rooms and the map {kind_room} {MAP} {PM_SameKindEquated}</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">This applies three tags to the section: <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">kind_room</span></span>, <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">MAP</span></span> and <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">PM_SameKindEquated</span></span>.
These are used by Inform for the helpful links in the Index or in problem
messages: for example, if the user generates the problem <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">PM_SameKindEquated</span></span>
(this is its internal designation, of course), a link will appear, and it
will be to this section, "Rooms and the map".
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP9" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;9. Indexing. </b>Indoc volumes are indexed in the same sort of way that books are, and
the author has to mark up indexing terms as they arise. The notation
for this is an elaboration of a scheme devised by Knuth for the TeX Book.
At its simplest,
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    I am the ^{walrus}.</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">becomes simply
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    I am the walrus.</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">in the generated HTML, but the position of the last word is added to a
new head-word in the index, "walrus". Where a double <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">^</span></span> is used, the
index entry is invisible in the text itself, and only the position is
marked. Thus
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    I am the ^{walrus}.^^{Beatles}</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">A much more detailed description now follows.
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP10" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;10.  </b>Some generalities first. The index consists of "headwords", the terms being
indexed (which may or may not be just one word). Each headword is followed by
a comma-separated list of links to sections of the books - both books are
indexed, not just one. Links to the primary volume have the form "5.4"; links
to the secondary are the same, but italicised. The list of links is always
ordered numerically within the primary volume.
</p>

<p class="commentary">Headwords are alphabetized in a way which excludes initial "a", "an" or "the";
if the first word is a number from 1 to 12, it's replaced by the spelled
version (thus "3 A.M." appears as if "three A.M."); other numbers are sorted
numerically - thus "Zone 10" appears after "Zone 9", not after "Zone 1"; and
any bracketed text is ignored for alphabetisation purposes - so "(leaf) tea"
is alphabetised as if it were "tea".
</p>

<p class="commentary">Each headword has a "category". These categories must be defined in the
instructions file, using <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">index:</span></span>. An index entry is defined by both headword
and category in combination, so "description" with category "property" is
different from "description" with category "standard", and they appear on
different lines in the index.
</p>

<p class="commentary">In terms of CSS, index entries occupy paragraphs of class <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">indexentry</span></span>.
Text of an entry of category C is in a span of class <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">indexC</span></span> (so for example,
an entry of category "name" is in a span of class <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">indexname</span></span>). The links
are in spans of class <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">indexlink</span></span> for the primary volume, <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">indexlinkalt</span></span>
for the secondary.
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP11" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;11.  </b>If no categories are defined, there's no index. The instruction needed is:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    index: notation = name (options)</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">Notation is how indoc should recognise material to index; name is the name
of the category; the options, which are optional, specify anything special
about the category. There are three sorts of notation. The first is the
caret-and-brace form, for example:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    index: ^{`headword} = name (invert)</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">    index: ^{headword} = standard</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">With these notations in place, a sentence in the documentation can be
marked up like so:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    The inventor of ^{literate programming} is ^{`Donald Knuth}.^^{archaisms}</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">Indexable terms always start with one or two carets and then material in
braces. One caret means the copy in braces is part of the book; two means
it isn't. Thus the above sentence typesets as
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    The inventor of literate programming is Donald Knuth.</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">A few points to note. The notations are sought in definition order, which
is why we defined ^{`headword} before ^{headword}. In general, the notation
has to be given in the form
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    ^{LheadwordR}</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">where <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">L</span></span> and <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">R</span></span> are clumps of 0 or more characters; for example,
<span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">^{+headword+}</span></span> would be legal, as would <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">^{''headword---}</span></span>. (It is best
to avoid underscores, asterisks, and of course braces.)
</p>

<p class="commentary">The catch-all <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">^{headword}</span></span> notation has to refer to the category called
"standard", and should be defined last.
</p>

<p class="commentary">Indexing can be inserted into the body text of either volume, or in the
example files. However, they can't be placed in headings of any kind, or
in indented sample code paragraphs.
</p>

<p class="commentary">In general the index hyperlinks are to the top of the section cited, e.g., a
link to 3.2 goes to the top of section 3.2; or to the example cited, usually
at the bottom of some section; except that links to a phrase definition (in
Inform) go straight to its tinted box.
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP12" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;12.  </b>The options for categories are as follows:
</p>

<p class="commentary">Because the name category is marked <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">(invert)</span></span>, its entries are inverted.
Thus <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">^{Donald Knuth}</span></span> actually indexes as "Knuth, Donald", alphabetised
under K not D. Inversion is not performed if the text already contains a comma.
This can override wrong guesses. Thus:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    Extensions are managed by ^{`Justin de Vesine}.</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">indexes "Vesine, Justin de" (filed under V); but
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    Extensions are managed by Justin de Vesine.^^{`de Vesine, Justin}</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">indexes "de Vesine, Justin" (filed under D).
</p>

<p class="commentary">An option in double-quotes becomes a gloss text for the category. What
that means is that this text is added as a gloss, in small type, after
every index entry of that category, using the CSS span <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">indexgloss</span></span>.
(By default, a category doesn't have a gloss.) Thus we might get index
entries like
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    grouping together something  activity  18.14</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">with "activity" being the gloss text.
</p>

<p class="commentary">The option <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">(bracketed)</span></span> causes the index entry to be rendered with bracketed
material in a CSS span called <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">indexCbracketed</span></span>, where C is the category name.
For example, the Inform 7 Indoc instructions go on to say:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    css: span.indexphrasebracketed ++ {</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">        color: #8080ff;</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">    }</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">The practical effect is that the index entry:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    (name of kind) after (enumerated value)  phrase  11.18</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">has the bracketed parts tinted in a light blue for de-emphasis.
</p>

<p class="commentary">The option <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">(under {lemma})</span></span> causes all entries for this category to be
subentries of <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">{lemma}</span></span> - see below.
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP13" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;13.  </b>The second sort of notation is by documentation tag. An instruction like so:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    index: {act_} = activity ("activity")</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">This tells Indoc to pick up the tags used for links in the Inform app (see
above) and turn them into index entries too: in this case, any tag beginning
with <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">act_</span></span> will be turned into an index entry of category "activity" for the
section in question, using the title of the section as the text of the entry,
flattened in case. The practical effect, then, is that all activities are
automatically indexed.
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP14" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;14.  </b>There are also two built-in sources of index entries, though they have
to be activated to appear. The Indoc instructions for Inform activate both:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    index: definition = phrase ("phrase") (bracketed)</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">    index: example = example ("example")</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">"definition" isn't really a notation; it tells indoc to make an index entry
out of every phrase definition in the manual. Similarly, "example" makes
an index entry for every example.
</p>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP15" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;15.  </b>If an entry's text contains a colon (with substantive material either side),
that's taken as a marker that something is a subentry. Thus:

<span class="plain-syntax">    reptiles</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">        snakes 3.7</span>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    "Why did it have to be snakes?" mused Indy.</span>
</pre>
<p class="commentary">Sub-entries can be arbitrarily deep; there can be, but need not be, index
entries for the super-entry (in this case "reptiles").
</p>

<p class="commentary">We can also force every entry of a given category to fall as a subentry.
For example:
</p>

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    index: ^{~headword} = reptilian (under {reptiles})</span>
</pre>

<p class="commentary firstcommentary"><a id="SP17" class="paragraph-anchor"></a><b>&#167;17. Example files. </b>Recall that each Example provided with the documentation &mdash; usually a
sample program &mdash; has its own source file. For example, in the standard
Inform repository, the example Alpaca Farm lives in:

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    Documentation/Examples/AlpacaFarm.txt</span>

<p class="commentary">Example files are just like volume files except that they open with a
special header of metadata. In this example, it's:

<pre class="displayed-code all-displayed-code code-font">
<span class="plain-syntax">    Example: * Alpaca Farm</span>
<span class="plain-syntax">    Location: New commands for old grammar</span>

<p class="commentary">Line 1 is required to take the form <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">Example: *** TITLE</span></span>, for some number of
asterisks between one and four - a measure of difficulty/complexity. By
convention the filename will be the same as the title but with punctuation
removed, but that is just a convention, and any filename can be used.
</p>

<p class="commentary">After line 1, further metadata lines can optionally appear, in any order, and then there
should be a skipped (i.e. completely blank) line before the body of the example
appears.
</p>

<p class="commentary">The possible metadata lines are:
</p>

<ul class="items"><li>(a) <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">Location: SECTION</span></span> gives the section name which an example should go into,
in the primary volume, if there are two. (For Inform, that's "Writing with Inform".)
</li><li>(b) <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">RecipeLocation: SECTION</span></span> similarly for the secondary volume. (For Inform,
that's "The Recipe Book".)
</li><li>(c) <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">Index: ENTRY</span></span> gives the example this explanatory index entry in the alphabetical
index of examples.
</li><li>(d) <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">Description: DESC</span></span> gives some text to use in the example heading, to explain
what it exemplifies.
</li><li>(e) <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">For: PLATFORM</span></span> is to do with testing the example, and is ignored by <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">indoc</span></span>.
</li><li>(f) <span class="extract"><span class="extract-syntax">Subtitle: SUBTITLE</span></span> is used only for examples occurring in numbered sequences,
where the same idea is elaborated in successive examples. For example:
</li></ul>
