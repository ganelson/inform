Index: TAKE scenery producing a custom response
Description: Changing the response when the player tries to take something that is scenery.
For: Z-Machine

By default, ``TAKE OAK`` in the example above will produce the response ``That's hardly portable.`` This is fine under many circumstances, but also a bit generic, so we might want to override it for a specific game.

	{*}"Replanting"
	
	The Orchard is a room. "Within this quadrille of pear trees, a single gnarled old oak remains as a memory of centuries past." The gnarled old oak tree is scenery in the Orchard.
	
	Instead of taking some scenery: say "You lack the hulk-like strength."
	
	Test me with "take oak".

Here we've used an `instead` rule; we will learn more about these in [Basic Actions]. This allows us to define our own results for taking an object.

Note: `scenery` is a property of an object (about which we will hear more later). So when we use it in rules, we can talk about `some scenery`, `something that is scenery`, or even `a scenery thing` – the last construction doesn't sound much like English, but works better with other adjectives, as in the example `a portable thing`.
