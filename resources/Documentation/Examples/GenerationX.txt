	{*}"Generation X"
	
	The Volunteer Center is a room. "A fairly spartan office, though there are a few attractive posters from advertising campaigns of the past, and an ominous map charting the deforestation of Brazil."
	
	The desk is scenery in the Volunteer Center. "Your standard metal desk, with a drawer for postal supplies and the like." On the desk is a pile of leaflets and a pile of business cards. The power stapler is a device on the desk. A drawer is part of the desk. It is openable and closed. In the drawer are a sponge and a roll of bulk-mail stamps.
	
	Instead of doing something:
		if examining, continue the action;
		if searching, continue the action;
		if looking, continue the action;
		if asking Jenna to try doing something, continue the action;
		say "The whole point of this exercise is to train Jenna. Once you have her on the envelope-stuffing, you can go make some calls."
	
	Instead of answering Jenna that something:
		say "You're going to have to break the instructions down to the simplest ones possible, given that she's in the mood to misunderstand on purpose."
	
	A cardboard box is in the Center. In the cardboard box is a pile of empty envelopes. The box is openable and closed. The description is "A recycling symbol is prominent on the side, which makes you feel a little bit better about using a mailing campaign for this cause."
	
	Jenna is a woman in the Volunteer Center. "Your daughter Jenna is here, barely visible through the cloud of resentment." The description is "Jenna [if jenna carries something]has [the list of things carried by Jenna][otherwise]returns your stare, with added hostility[end if]."
	
	A persuasion rule for asking Jenna to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.
	
	Unsuccessful attempt by Jenna doing something:
		repeat through Table of Retorts:
			if the reason the action failed is the cause entry:
				say "[response entry][paragraph break]";
				rule succeeds;
		say "'I don't see how I'm supposed to do that, Mom,' Jenna says."

	To say physical impossibility:
		say "'Maybe you should've brought someone a little stronger,' Jenna says. 'Like the Incredible Hulk.' "
	
	To say already done:
		repeat through Table of Bored Remarks:
			say "[response entry]";
			blank out the whole row;
			rule succeeds;
		say "'Okay, I'm going to be, like, in the car,' says Jenna. 'Outside.' ";
		end the story saying "Jenna has gotten fed up".

	response
	"'Did that,' says Jenna."
	"'Check,' says Jenna."
	"'Yeah, Mom, I already did that, okay?'"
	"'Look, if I have to be here doing dumb stuff, could you at least tell me to do stuff that isn't already done?' Jenna asks wearily."
	"Jenna gives a great upward sigh, riffling her bangs. 'Once again... there is totally no point.'"
