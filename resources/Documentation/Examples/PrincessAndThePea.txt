Description: The player is unable to sleep on a mattress (or stack of mattresses) because the bottom one has something uncomfortable under it.
For: Z-Machine

^^{Finding the bottom of a pile}

The main point here is that we need to figure out where the stack meets the floor:

	{*}"Princess and the Pea"
	
	The Topmost Turret is a room. A mattress is a kind of supporter. A mattress is always enterable. A mattress is portable.
	
	A large mattress is a mattress in the Turret. A medium mattress is a mattress in the Turret. A small mattress is a mattress in the Turret.
	
	Instead of sleeping when the player is on a mattress (called the bed):
		let the item be the bed;
		while the holder of the item is not a room:
			let the item be the holder of the item;
		say "You can still feel something very uncomfortable under [the item]."
	
	Instead of sleeping:
		say "You can't sleep standing up!"
	
	Instead of looking under a mattress, say "You scout around, but are unable to determine what's causing you this discomfort. If only your maid Winnie were here. She's very good at this."
	
	Test me with "sleep / enter small / sleep / get up / get small / put small on medium / get on small / sleep / get up / g / get medium / put medium on large / get on small / look / sleep".
