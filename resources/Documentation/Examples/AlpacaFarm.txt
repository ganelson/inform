Whether we actually want a ``USE`` action is a subject of some theoretical debate in the IF community. On the one hand, it helps avoid guess-the-verb problems where the player cannot figure out what term to use in order to express a fairly simple idea. On the other, it encourages the player to think that all items have one and exactly one use, rather than getting them to consider the range of possibilities that arise from having a complex vocabulary.
