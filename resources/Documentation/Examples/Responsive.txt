Description: Altering the standard inventory text for when the player is carrying nothing.
For: Z-Machine

The most straightforward way to alter the response text for something in the standard rules is to select the Index tab, then select Actions, then pick the particular action whose text we'd like to alter. Under action details, there will be icons that look like speech bubbles.

Clicking on the speech bubble will show what the current response text is, and give us an option called "set".

If we click "set", this will automatically paste in the response name that we need to change. We can put this inside a "when play begins" rule in order to make that change take effect from the start of the game, like so:

	{*}"Responsive"
	
	An Anonymous B613 Cell is a room. "There isn't much to see in this bare room. What there is, you've already seen sometime in the last twenty years."
	
	When play begins:
		now print empty inventory rule response (A) is "[We] [have] absolutely nothing.".
	
	Test me with "i".
