Science Journalism Desk
From here you, the Science Anchor, have the privilege of reporting the latest and most fascinating stories to an eager public.

Currently you have to report on the International Space Station. Your story could include the experiment module, the logistics module, the solar array, the individual solar cell and the orbit height.

>(Testing.)

>[1] report experiment module
You turn to the camera and speak: "The experiment module has a length of roughly 7.34211 bathtubs." 

>[2] report logistics
 "The logistics module has a length of around 2.76974 bathtubs." Right now the station will be cutting over to a visual of that.

>[3] report height
Turning to another camera angle, you add: "The station orbits at heights between about 627.53949 Empire State buildings and 1038.37476 Empire State buildings above the earth." 

>[4] report array
 "The solar array has a length of roughly 1.16 Olympic swimming pools and an area of approximately 125.0 queen-sized mattresses." Pity the kids in audiovisual who have to scare that image together in a hurry.

>[5] report solar cell
 "The individual solar cell has an area of roughly 0.17391 credit cards." You smile brightly.

And that's all! The channel cuts to weather.
