^^{Regions, travelling from}

Suppose that we want to have something happen when the player leaves a region we've defined. `Instead of going from (the region)...` will not suffice for this, because this rule will be invoked every time the player successfully leaves a room within the region, whether or not they are going to a room that is also in the same region.

Instead we need a rule that is a bit more specific, like this:

	{*}"Veronica"
	
	Neptune is a region.
	
	Tijuana is a room.
	
	High School is north of Tijuana. It is in Neptune.
	
	Detective Offices is west of High School. It is in Neptune.
	
	The player is in High School.
	
	Instead of going from Neptune to a room which is not in Neptune:
		say "It's a bad time to leave Neptune."
	
	Test me with "s / w / e".
