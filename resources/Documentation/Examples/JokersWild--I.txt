  Empty Room
  It has come to this: sitting on the bare floor of Lulu's apartment with nothing to amuse you but a deck of cards and the top hat from last year's act. You reckon fifty-two cardtosses are all that stand between you and the utter pointlessness of existence.
  
  Once again you curse Lulu for running off with that joker.
