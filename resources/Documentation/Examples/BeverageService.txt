^^{drinking+action+: a potion which then goes away}

Some kinds of game objects – food, for instance – can only sensibly be used once, and should then be destroyed. The ``EAT`` command already implements this, but suppose we also had a category of drinkable potions:

	{*}"Beverage Service"
	
	A potion is a kind of thing. The sparkly blue potion is a potion carried by the player.
	
	Level 3 is a room.
	
	Instead of drinking a potion (called the drink):
		now the drink is nowhere;
		say "You quaff [the drink]. It goes down beautifully."
	
	Test me with "drink sparkly / i".
