^^{missing noun: supplying a missing noun/second noun+activity+}

If we're defining actions for other characters to follow, we may want to include them in our `rule for supplying a missing noun`. We can do this if we write our `while...` clause to apply to any actor, as follows:

	{*}"Latin Lessons"
	
	The Latin Studio is a room. Rick is a man in the Studio.
	
	A dance-name is a kind of thing. Argentine tango, samba, merengue, cha-cha, street salsa are dance-names.
	
	Dancing is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand "dance [any dance-name]" as dancing. Understand "dance" as dancing.
	
	Rule for supplying a missing noun while an actor dancing:
		now the noun is street salsa.
	
	Report someone dancing:
		say "[The actor] dances a few steps of [the noun] for you."
	
	Report dancing:
		say "You dance a few steps of [the noun]."
	
	Persuasion rule for asking someone to try dancing: persuasion succeeds.
	
	Test me with "dance / dance samba / rick, dance / rick, dance merengue".
