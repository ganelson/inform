Description: Adding coloured text to the example of door-status readouts.
For: Z-Machine

The extension "Basic Screen Effects" provides a few more type styles, in the form of coloured lettering. The colours available are red, yellow, green, blue, white, magenta, and cyan, as well as the usual black; and to restore the player's default screen colour, we say "default letters".

Thus if we wanted to highlight locked and unlocked doors in our security readout example:

	{*}"Garibaldi"
	
	Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.
	
	The security readout is a device. The description of the readout is "The screen is blank."
	
	Instead of examining the switched on security readout:
		say "The screen reads: [fixed letter spacing]";
		say line break;
		repeat with item running through doors:
			say line break;
			say "  [item] ([front side of the item]/[back side of the item]): [if the item is locked][green letters]LOCKED[default letters][otherwise][red letters]UNLOCKED[default letters][end if]";
		say variable letter spacing;
		say paragraph break.
	
	The player carries the security readout.
	
	The Docking Bay is a room. The inner airlock is a door. It is north of the Docking Bay and south of the Zocalo. The inner airlock is lockable and unlocked.  The outer airlock is lockable and locked. It is a door. It is south of the Docking Bay and north of Space.
	
	The quarantine seal is a door. It is west of the Zocalo and east of Medlab. Quarantine seal is locked.
	
	The security pass unlocks the inner airlock. The player carries the security pass.
	
	Test me with "x readout / turn on readout / x readout / lock inner airlock with security pass / x readout".

Note that this extension does not currently produce the desired effects when compiling with the Glulx setting; to see it working, make sure that the settings tab is set to compile to the Z-machine.
