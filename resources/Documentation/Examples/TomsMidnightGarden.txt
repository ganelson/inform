Index: Clocks that can be SET TO any time
Description: A clock kind that can be set to any time using "the time understood"; may be turned on and off; and will advance itself only when running. Time on the face is also reported differently depending on whether the clock is analog or digital.
For: Z-Machine

^^{Clocks that can be SET TO any time}

Time can also be understood as a token, and the time parsed will be recorded as `the time understood`. So therefore, if we wish for clocks which may be set:

	{*}"Tom's Midnight Garden"
	
	A clock is a kind of device. A clock has a time called the current time. A clock can be analog or digital. The current time of a clock is usually 9:01 AM. The description of a clock is "It shows the time to be [if analog]about [the current time to the nearest five minutes in words][otherwise][the current time][end if]."
	
	Understand "set [clock] to [time]" as setting it by time. Setting it by time is an action applying to one thing and one time.
	
	Instead of setting a clock to something:
		say "[The noun] can be set only to a time of day, such as 8:00 AM, or midnight."
	
	Carry out setting a clock by time:
		now the current time of the noun is the time understood.
	
	Report setting a clock by time:
		say "You set [the noun] to [time understood]."
	
	Every turn:
		repeat with item running through switched on clocks:
			now the current time of the item is one minute after the current time of the item.
	
	The Hall is a room. The grandfather clock is a fixed in place analog clock in the Hall. The travel clock is a switched on digital clock in the Hall.  When play begins: now the right hand status line is "[time of day]".
	
	Test me with "examine grandfather clock / set it to midnight / switch it on / wait / wait / wait / examine it / set travel clock to 4:12 / examine it".
