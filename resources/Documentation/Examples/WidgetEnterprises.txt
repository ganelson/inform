Description: Allowing the player to set a price for a widget on sale, then determining the resulting sales based on consumer demand, and the resulting profit and loss.
For: Z-Machine

Suppose the player is responsible for pricing at Widget Enterprises. Widget production entails a certain fixed cost as well as a cost per unit; and somewhere out in the world there are a number of customers interested in purchasing widgets, but the player starts without knowing what this distribution looks like.

We can express the profits as an equation: the total made by selling widgets, minus the cost thereof.

The Table of Customers holds the data about customer preferences, and whenever the player selects a widget price, we consult it to determine how many customers in total would be willing to buy at that price.

	Widget Stand is a room.
	
	A monetary value is a kind of value. $1.99 specifies a monetary value with parts dollars and cents.
	
	Equation - Profit Equation
		P = nV - (F + nC)
	where P is a monetary value, F is the fixed cost, C is the unit cost, V is a monetary value, and n is a number.
	
	The fixed cost is a monetary value that varies. The fixed cost is $5.00.
	The unit cost is a monetary value that varies. The unit cost is $10.66.
	
	Table of Customers
	base	maximum value
	2	$26.00
	5	$20.00
	8 	$15.00
	2	$13.50
	1	$9.00
	
	To decide what number is the units sold at (V - a monetary value):
		let total units be 0;
		repeat through the Table of Customers:
			if V is less than the maximum value entry:
				increase total units by the base entry;
		decide on total units.
	
	Understand "set price to [monetary value]" as setting price to. Setting price to is an action applying to one monetary value.
	
	Carry out setting price to:
		let V be the monetary value understood;
		let n be the units sold at the monetary value understood;
		let P be given by the Profit Equation;
		say "You set the price of your widgets to [V], resulting in sales of [n] unit[s] and ";
		if P is less than $0.00:
			let L be $0.00 - P;
			say "a loss of [L].";
		otherwise if P is $0.00:
			say "break even.";
		otherwise:
			say "a profit of [P].".
	
	Test me with "set price to $0.00 / set price to $100.00 / set price to $15.00 / set price to $8.00 / set price to $25.00 / set price to $14.99".

As written this will be a rather dull guessing game for the player; more interesting would be to enhance it into a fuller economic simulator with more control over fixed costs and customer price points.
