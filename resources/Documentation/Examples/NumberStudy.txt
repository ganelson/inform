Index: Numbers in relations
Description: The parity and joint magnitude relations explored.
For: Z-Machine

This is the same case given above, but expanded just slightly to demonstrate that the names of the relations can also be printed, if we like:

	{*}"Number Study"
	
	Abstraction is a room.
	
	Parity relates a number (called N) to a number (called M) when N minus M is even.
	
	Joint magnitude relates a number (called N) to a number (called M) when N plus M is greater than 7.
	
	To chart (R - a relation of numbers):
		repeat with N running from 1 to 5:
			repeat with M running from 1 to 5:
				if R relates N to M, say "[N] <=> [M] by [R][line break]";
	
	When play begins:
		let L be { parity relation, joint magnitude relation };
		repeat with R running through L:
			chart R.

As this shows, we can even form lists of relations. The kind of `L` is `list of relations of numbers`.
