Backstage
You can see Taylor here.

>(Testing.)

>[1] taylor, sing
You ask Taylor to sing your favorite song, the one that was unaccountably left off tonight's set list. Just one verse would do.

Taylor: "I'll consider your request, but only if you sing something first."

You: "You can't be serious."

Taylor: "I absolutely am. I want to see what you've got."

(1) Okay.
(2) Definitely not.

>[2] 1
Okay.

You nod anxiously, aware of all the other VIP ticket holders standing around and poised to judge you.

You sing a rousing rendition of Yankee Doodle Dandy. For some reason it's the only song whose lyrics you can fully remember right now.

Taylor: "Little shaky on the intro, but not bad. I'd say you've earned your piece. Wouldn't you?"

She turns to the other fans expectantly, and they cheer.

Taylor launches into "Electric Touch."

>[3] taylor, sing
You ask Taylor to sing your favorite song, the one that was unaccountably left off tonight's set list. Just one verse would do.

Taylor: "I'll consider your request, but only if you sing something first."

You: "You can't be serious."

Taylor: "I absolutely am. I want to see what you've got."

(1) Okay.
(2) Definitely not.

>[4] 2
Definitely not.

You: "No, the deal is off."

Taylor: "Then I can't help you."

So much for that.

>Are you sure you want to quit?
