Example: * Hayseed
Location: Try and try silently

Index: Staircase kind of door which diverts the CLIMB command
Description: A refinement of our staircase kind which can be climbed.
For: Z-Machine

Presumably all staircase-type connections between rooms should respond when the player says ``CLIMB STAIRS`` (or the equivalent). So

	{*}"Hayseed"
	
	A staircase is a kind of door. A staircase is usually open. A staircase is seldom openable.
	
	The ladder is a staircase. It is above the Barn and below the Hayloft.
	
	Instead of climbing a staircase:
		try entering the noun.
	
	Test me with "climb ladder / g".

Attempts to climb other types of door will still be treated as useless.
