Example: * Disenchantment Bay 6
Location: Locks and keys
RecipeLocation: Disenchantment Bay
Index: Disenchantment Bay 6. Locked-up fishing rods
Description: Disenchantment Bay: locking up the charter boat's fishing rods.
For: Untestable

It stands to reason that the captain wouldn't let just anyone meddle with his fishing equipment; maybe he keeps that case locked. We could replace the case description with this one, instead:

	{*}The Cabin contains a glass case. In the glass case is a collection of fishing rods. The case is closed, transparent, openable, lockable, and locked. The case is scenery. The small silver key unlocks the case.

Now there's a silver key that will unlock it – though since we haven't said where the key is, the player will never be able to find it in the game. (If we look at the World index, we find `small silver key` right at the bottom, not inside any of the rooms. That is as good as not existing at all – though we usually use the term `out of play` – but as we will later see, it is possible to have things initially out of play but brought into existence later on.)
