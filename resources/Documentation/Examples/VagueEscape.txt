* Supplying a missing noun/second noun
(GO equivalent to GO OUT; Minimal Movement)
Supplying a default direction for "go", so that "leave", "go", etc., are always interpreted as "out".

Sometimes it would be nice to respond a little more sensitively to a vague command such as "leave" -- converting it, perhaps, to a "go out" command.

	{*}"Minimal Movement"

	The Doll-like House is a room. The Postage-Stamp-Sized Garden is outside from the House.

	Rule for supplying a missing noun while going:
		now noun is outside.
    	
This particular situation is very slightly complicated by the existing rules about vague movement, but fortunately we can easily turn those off.

	{**}The block vaguely going rule is not listed in the for supplying a missing noun rules.
	
	Test me with "go".
