^^{Understanding names of things, basic}

Sometimes we create objects that we want the player to be able to call by different names: a television that should also answer to ``TV`` and ``TELLY``, for instance, or a refrigerator the player might also call ``FRIDGE``. In this case, we can use instructions like

	Understand "tv" and "telly" as the television.

to add extra names to the object we've defined.

	{*}"First Name Basis"
	
	The Crew Lounge is a room. "Deliberately spartan: the crew feels weight restrictions here first, so there aren't any chairs, just a few thin pads on the ground."
	
	The holographic projector is a device in the Crew Lounge. "The one major source of entertainment is the holographic projector, a top of the line Misthon 9000, on which you view every beam you can get." Understand "holo" or "holograph" or "Misthon" or "9000" as the projector.
	
	The description of the projector is "[if switched on]The projector is now playing a documentary about the early politics of the Mars colony.[otherwise]The air above the projector is disappointingly clear.[end if]".

(This description is for local colour; we will learn more about devices, and conditions like `if switched on`, later in this chapter.)

By default, Inform does not understand the names of an object's kind as referring to that object, unless the object has no other name of its own. We can change this, if we like, by defining names that should be applied to everything of a given kind:

	{**}Lewis and Harper are men in the Crew Lounge. Understand "man" or "guy" or "chap" or "lad" or "male" as a man. Understand "men" or "chaps" or "lads" or "guys" or "males" as the plural of a man.
	
	The description of Lewis is "A wiry, excitable engineer who just signed aboard last week." The description of Harper is "Harper's a good guy: taciturn when sober, affectionate when drunk, but rarely annoying in either state."
	
	Test me with "x holo / x man / lewis / x guy / harper / turn on projector / x holo projector / get men".

Inform's naming abilities go considerably further, in fact: we can also instruct it to understand words only under certain circumstances, or only when they appear with other words. Fuller details may be found in the chapter on [Understanding].
