Description: A scoreboard that keeps track of the ten highest-scoring players from one playthrough to the next, adding the player's name if they have done well enough.
For: Glulx

The trick here is that we need a table with text in order to keep track of the players' names.

Part 1 largely replicates the source from [Identity Theft]; new material starts at Part 2.

	{*}"Rubies"
	
	Use scoring.
	
	Part 1 - Collecting Names
	
	The player's forename is a text that varies. The player's full name is a text that varies.
	
	When play begins:
		now the command prompt is "What is your name? > ".
	
	To decide whether collecting names:
		if the command prompt is "What is your name? > ", yes;
		no.
	
	After reading a command when collecting names:
		if the number of words in the player's command is greater than 5:
			say "[paragraph break]Who are you, a member of the British royal family? No one has that many names. Let's try this again.";
			reject the player's command;
		now the player's full name is the player's command;
		now the player's forename is word number 1 in the player's command;
		now the command prompt is ">";
		say "Hi, [player's forename]!";
		say "[banner text]";
		move the player to the location;
		reject the player's command.
	
	Instead of looking when collecting names: do nothing.
	
	Rule for printing the banner text when collecting names: do nothing.
	
	Rule for constructing the status line when collecting names: do nothing.
	
	Part 2 - Adding the Leaderboard
	
	File of Leaderboard is called "leaderboard".
	
	When play begins:
		if the File of Leaderboard exists:
			read File of Leaderboard into the Table of Leaders;
			sort the Table of Leaders in reverse scored amount order.
	
	When play ends:
		choose row 10 in the Table of Leaders; [we've sorted the table, so the lowest score will be the one at the bottom]
		if the score is greater than scored amount entry:
			now name entry is the player's forename;
			now the scored amount entry is the score;
		show leaderboard;
		write the File of Leaderboard from the Table of Leaders.
	
	To show leaderboard:
		sort the Table of Leaders in reverse scored amount order;
		say "Current leading scores: [paragraph break]";
		say fixed letter spacing;
		repeat through Table of Leaders:
			if scored amount entry is greater than 0:
				say "  [name entry]";
				let N be 25 minus the number of characters in name entry; [here we want to space out the scores so they make a neat column]
				if N is less than 1, now N is 1;
				say N spaces;
				say "[scored amount entry][line break]";
		say variable letter spacing.
	
	To say (N - a number) spaces:
		repeat with index running from 1 to N:
			say " ".
	
	Table of Leaders
	scored amount	name
	0	"Smithee"
	0	"Smithee"
	0	"Smithee"
	0	"Smithee"
	0	"Smithee"
	0	"Smithee"
	0	"Smithee"
	0	"Smithee"
	0	"Smithee"
	0	"Smithee"

And now we introduce a scenario that allows different players to come up with different scores – admittedly not a very interesting scenario, but it will do for now:

	{**}Part 3 - Scenario
	
	Carry out taking something which is not handled:
		increment score.
	
	The Big Treasure Chamber is a room. It contains a ruby, an emerald, a gold tooth, an antique katana, and a silver coin.
	
	Instead of waiting, end the story finally.
	
	Test me with "get ruby / z".
