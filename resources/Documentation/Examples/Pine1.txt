^^{Pine 1. Waking the Princess}

Because scene rules are checked every turn, they can be useful for designing puzzles which have multiple solutions. Instead of deciding the puzzle is `solved` when the player does a certain action, we set up a scene that checks to see whether the player has achieved a certain outcome â€“ however they accomplished it.

For instance, in this scenario, we're waiting for Sleeping Beauty to wake up, and it doesn't much matter how...

	{*}"Pine"
	
	A person can be asleep or awake. A person can be active or passive.
	
	The Spinning Tower is a room. "A remote corner of the old castle, reserved for spinning and weaving tasks."
	
	Sleeping Beauty is an asleep woman in the Spinning Tower. "[if asleep]Sleeping Beauty lies here, oblivious to your presence[otherwise]Sleeping Beauty stands beside you, looking a little confused[end if]." The description is "She is even more magnificent than the rumors suggested." Understand "woman" or "girl" or "princess" or "lady" as Sleeping Beauty.
	
	Discovery is a scene. Discovery begins when play begins. Discovery ends when Sleeping Beauty is awake. Marriage Proposal is a scene. Marriage Proposal begins when Discovery ends.
	
	When Discovery ends: say "Throughout the palace you can hear the other sounds of stirring and movement as the spell of centuries is broken."
	
	Instead of waking an awake person: say "Redundant."
	
	Instead of waking an asleep person: say "Yes, but how?"
	
	Instead of attacking an asleep person:
		now the noun is awake;
		say "[The noun] sits bolt upright. 'Hey! Ow!' So much for that true love's kiss nonsense."
	
	Instead of kissing an asleep person:
		now the noun is awake;
		say "[The noun] slowly stirs to wakefulness!"
	
	Instead of throwing water at an asleep person:
		now the second noun is awake;
		now the noun is nowhere;
		say "You pour out [the noun] on [the second noun].
	
	[The second noun] wakes, shuddering. 'Agh! I had a terrible dream about drowning and then-- Hey!'"
	
	The player carries a jug of water. Understand "pour [something] on [something]" or "splash [something] at/on [something]" as throwing it at.
	
	Test me with "x beauty / wake beauty / pour water on beauty".
