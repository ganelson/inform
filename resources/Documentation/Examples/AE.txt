Example: ** A&E
Location: Going from, going to
RecipeLocation: Map
Index: Region off-limits to a player without VIP pass
Description: Using regions to block access to an entire area when the player does not carry a pass, regardless of which entrance they use.
For: Z-Machine

Rules about going to regions make it easy to exclude the player from a large portion of the map, even if there are many connecting paths to the region. For instance, in this story it would be annoying to have to write a rule about all four exits by which the player could reach the film set area:

	{*}"A&E"
	
	Winding Street is a room. Winding Street is west of Duck Pond. Sloping Street is north of Winding Street, northwest of Duck Pond, west of Stately Lawn, and southwest of Stately Home. Stately Lawn is north of Duck Pond. Stately Home is north of Stately Lawn.
	
	Film Set is a region. Duck Pond, Stately Lawn, and Stately Home are in Film Set.
	
	Instead of going to Film Set when the player does not carry the VIP Pass: say "A burly studio guard materializes in your path, convincing you that you would prefer to be elsewhere."
	
	The VIP Pass is in the garbage can. The garbage can is in Sloping Street.
	
	After going to the Film Set:
		say "Success! At last you are inside the set of 'Prouder and More Prejudiced'. Next step: locating Mr Firth.";
		end the story finally.
	
	Test me with "e / n / e / get pass / e".
