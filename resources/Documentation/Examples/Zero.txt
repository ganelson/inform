Index: Horribly heavy box described differently after being taken
Description: A box which called "horribly heavy box" after the player has tried to take it the first time.
For: Z-Machine

The names of objects might want to change also:

	{*}"Zero"
	
	Weight is a kind of value. The weights are light, manageable, and horribly heavy. Everything has a weight.
	
	A thing is usually manageable.

This does require a rule for an activity (see [Activities]), but it's a fairly straightforward one:

	{**}Before printing the name of a horribly heavy thing (called weighty object):
		if we have taken the weighty object, say "[weight] ".
	
	The Nearly Empty Living Room is a room. "Nearly everything is out, all of Helen's possessions and most of yours." A man called Mr Zero is in the Nearly Empty Living Room. "Mr Zero, despite being heavily paid to assist in this operation, is giving you a look that clearly conveys his lack of interest in budging even one more item." The description of Mr Zero is "Many muscles, no hair."
	
	The book box is a horribly heavy thing in the Living Room. The clothing box is a manageable thing in the Living Room. A broom, a dustpan, some packing tape, and a discarded newspaper are light things in the Living Room.
	
	After taking a horribly heavy thing:
		say "Taken. (Oof.)"
	
	Test me with "get clothing / look / get book box / look / i / drop book box / look".
