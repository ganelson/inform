Apologies to the shade of A. E. Housman.

	{*}"Fragment of a Greek Tragedy"
	
	Understand "restart/restore/save/quit" as "[meta-command]".
	
	After reading a command:
		if the player's command matches "[meta-command]", make no decision;
		say line break;
		repeat through Table of Current Topics:
			if the player's command includes topic entry:
				say "CHORUS: [reply entry][paragraph break]";
				follow the advance time rule;
				rule succeeds;
		say "[italic type]   Pause.[roman type][line break]";
		follow the advance time rule;
		rule succeeds.
	
	Table of Current Topics
	topic	reply
	"journey/trip/travel/came/arrived"	"Sailing on horseback, or with feet for oars?"
	"horseback/legs/feet/oars"	"Beneath a shining or a rainy Zeus?"
	"shining/rainy/weather/zeus"	"Mud's sister, not herself, adorns thy boots."

This would be a bit bare if we didn't provide the player with some sort of context at the outset, so let's put some remarks before the first command prompt:

	{**}Before reading a command while the turn count is 1:
		say "CHORUS: O suitably-attired-in-leather-boots	Head of a traveller, wherefore seeking whom	Whence by what way how purposed art thou come	To this well-nightingaled vicinity?	My object in inquiring is to know.	But if you happen to be deaf and dumb	And do not understand a word I say,	Then wave your hand, to signify as much."

This `turn count` condition is why it was useful to follow the advance time rule in `after reading a command`: the game (or drama, if you like) will continue to count moves elapsed even though the rest of Inform's command parsing and world model is being ignored. In a longer and more ambitious implementation of this idea, we might want to allow scenes to govern the behaviour and responses of the Chorus.

And then to give the whole exchange a play's format:

	{**}The Stage is a room.
	
	The room description heading rule is not listed in the carry out looking rules.
	
	When play begins:
		now the command prompt is "YOU: ";
		now left hand status line is "Fragment of a Greek Tragedy";
		now right hand status line is "A. E. Housman".

(Because this example manipulates commands outside of the normal parser, the mechanism for ``TEST`` will not work here. Try typing commands such as: ``TELL CHORUS ABOUT JOURNEY`` / ``TELL CHORUS ABOUT FEET`` / ``TELL CHORUS ABOUT SHROPSHIRE`` / ``TELL CHORUS ABOUT ZEUS``)
