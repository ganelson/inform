We can add the handling of multiple objects to an existing action simply by adding in a line of grammar using `"[things]"`. In response, Inform will consider every object accepted by the token, and perform the action once for each of those objects. Thus:

	The Treasury is a room. The vault is a lockable locked closed openable container in the Treasury. It is fixed in place. "A massive vault fills up one wall." The description is "The vault's system includes [a list of things which are part of the vault]."
