Description: Using text substitution to make characters reply differently under the same circumstances.
For: Z-Machine

We can use these substitutions to put together fairly complicated variations within a single piece of text:

	{*}"Fifty Ways to Leave Your Larva"
	
	The Beekeeper's Palace is a room. Wasp is a woman in the palace. Drone is a man in the palace.
	
	Instead of kissing someone:
		say "'[denial], [insult]! [boast]!'";

In this context, [denial] is understood to refer to the denial property of the noun – but we could spell it out with "denial of the noun" if we wanted to.

	{**}A person has some text called denial. The denial of a person is usually "Stand back". The denial of Drone is "You forget yourself"
	
	A person has some text called  insult. The insult of a person is usually "Grasshopper". The insult of Wasp is "Larva".
	
	A person has some text called  boast. The boast of a person is usually "I am ferocious". The boast of Drone is "I have ferocious allies".

And then it would be trivial to insert further rules using these responses:

	{**}Instead of attacking someone:
		say "'Get away, [insult]!'"
	
	Test me with "kiss wasp / hit wasp / hit drone / kiss drone".
