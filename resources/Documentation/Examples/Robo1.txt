^^{Robo 1. Robot that stores only one program at a time}

	{*}"Robo"
	
	The Experimentation Chamber is a room. Robo is a person in the Experimentation Chamber. "Robo, your prototype tin companion, stands awkwardly beside you. In the middle of its chest is a red enamel button[if the red button is switched on], currently depressed[otherwise], currently un-depressed[end if]."
	
	The red button is a device. It is part of Robo. Instead of pushing the red button: if the red button is switched off, try switching on the red button; otherwise try switching off the red button.
	
	After switching on the red button:
		say "CLICK! Robo is now in play-back mode."
	
	After switching off the red button:
		say "CLACK! Robo is now in observation mode."
	
	Definition: Robo is watching if the red button is switched off.
	
	The current instruction set is a list of stored actions that varies.
	
	After doing something when Robo is watching and Robo can see the player:
		now the actor is Robo;
		add the current action to the current instruction set;
		now the actor is the player;
		say "Robo watches you [the current action][one of], its yellow eyes lamp-like and observant[or]. In its metal head, gears whirr[or], its brushed-copper handlebar moustaches twitching[or] impassively[at random].";
		continue the action.
	
	Every turn when Robo is not watching:
		if the number of entries in the current instruction set is 0:
			say "Robo has run out of behavior and grinds to an (expectant) halt.";
			now the red button is switched off;
		otherwise:
			let the next task be entry 1 of the current instruction set;
			try the next task;
			remove entry 1 from the current instruction set.
	
	The red block and the blue cylinder are things in the Experimentation Chamber. The counter is a supporter in the Experimentation Chamber. The counter is scenery.
	
	Report Robo examining Robo:
		say "Robo examines each of its hands in turn, then each of his legs (bending over mostly double in the middle to do this)." instead.
	
	Report Robo examining the player:
		say "Robo stares at you, unblinkingly, for several seconds together[if a random chance of 1 in 7 succeeds]. Its left moustache-bar twitches infinitesimally upward[end if]." instead.
	
	Report Robo taking the cylinder:
		say "[one of][Robo] needs several attempts to get its metal fingers around [the cylinder] -- they are not designed for grasping small objects elegantly. But at last it succeeds[or]Once again, Robo struggles a bit before picking up [the cylinder][stopping]." instead.
	
	Test me with "z / take cylinder / take block / put cylinder on counter / put block on counter / x robo / x me / get block / drop block / press red button / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z".
