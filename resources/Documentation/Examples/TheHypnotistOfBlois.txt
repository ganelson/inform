	{*}"The Hypnotist of Blois"
	
	A person is either hypnotized or alert. A person is usually alert.
	
	Persuasion rule for asking a hypnotized person to try doing something:
		persuasion succeeds.
	
	Understand "hypnotize [someone]" as hypnotizing.
	
	Hypnotizing is an action applying to one thing.
	
	Check hypnotizing:
		if the noun is hypnotized, say "Already done." instead.
	
	Carry out hypnotizing:
		now the noun is hypnotized.
	
	Report hypnotizing:
		say "[The noun] slips under your control."
	
	Instead of waking someone hypnotized:
		now the noun is alert;
		say "[The noun] returns abruptly to consciousness."

The following prevents the hypnosis patient from trying to hypnotise us in turn. Note that `check someone hypnotizing someone` effectively stops anybody other than the player-character from performing this action.

	{**}Check someone hypnotizing someone:
		stop the action.
	
	Maison de la Magie is a room. "In a darkened room, a few hundreds of paces from the chateau of Blois, you give to tourists three shows a day: displaying to them power they do not comprehend and spectacles they do not deserve."
	
	A volunteer is a woman in the Maison. "A volunteer from the audience stands facing you, [if alert]skeptically awaiting hypnosis[otherwise]her face worshipful and obedient[end if]." The printed name of the volunteer is "volunteer from the audience". The description is "A distracted, susceptible woman." The volunteer wears a t-shirt and a baseball hat.
	
	The player wears a top hat and a cape.
	
	Test me with "volunteer, remove hat / hypnotize volunteer / look / volunteer, remove hat / wake volunteer / volunteer, wear hat".
