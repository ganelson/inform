^^{Red sticky label}

	{*}"Brown"
	
	The Shipping Room is a room. The red sticky label is a thing carried by the player. The description of the red sticky label is "It reads: AIRMAIL[if the label is part of something (called the parent)]. It is stuck to [the parent][end if]."
	
	A black crate is in Shipping. The description is "A boring black crate."  The brown crate is a thing in Shipping. The description is "An ordinary brown crate."
	
	After examining something when the label is part of the noun:
		say "A bright red sticky label is attached to [the noun]!"

Here is the essential point: whenever we ``ATTACH LABEL TO`` something, it becomes part of that object.

	{**}Instead of tying the red sticky label to something:
		now the red sticky label is part of the second noun;
		say "You stick [the label] to [the second noun]."

And of course the label cannot be stuck to itself or to more than one thing at a time.

	{**}Before tying the label to something when the label is part of something:
		if the label is part of the second noun:
			say "[The label] is already stuck to [the second noun]." instead;
		otherwise:
			say "(first freeing the label)[line break]";
			silently try taking the label;
			if the label is part of something, stop the action.
	
	Instead of tying the red sticky label to the label:
		say "That would ruin the label entirely."
	
	Instead of taking the label when the label is part of something:
		now the player carries the label;
		say "You peel the label off again."

Much of the rest is just tidying to make sure that the player's commands are redirected into the right syntax.

	{**}Instead of tying something to the label:
		try tying the label to the noun.
	
	Instead of putting the label on something:
		try tying the label to the second noun.
	
	Instead of inserting the label into something:
		try tying the label to the second noun.
	
	Understand the commands "stick" or "apply" as "tie".

We could have created a new `sticking` action, but to keep the example short we will use the built-in `tying it to` action instead, and respond to the command ``STICK`` just as if it were ``TIE``.

	{**}Understand "peel [something]" or "peel off [something]" as taking.
	
	Test me with "i / put label on the black crate / look / x black / x label / get the label / apply label to brown crate / look / x brown / peel off label / stick label to label".
