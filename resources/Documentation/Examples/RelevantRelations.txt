Index: Describing relations using a random choice of verb
Description: An example of how to create room descriptions that acknowledge particular relations using their assigned verbs, rather than by the heavily special-cased code used by the standard library.
For: Z-Machine

Suppose that we wanted authors to be able to indicate which relations should or should not be included in room descriptions, and have the system dynamically honour that instruction.

Inform already knows about verbs for describing supporting, containment, carrying, and wearing, so we could write a set of instructions to handle such cases. To do this, we're using the `writing a paragraph about` activity, which is described in the chapter on [Activities].

The following uses what is, strictly speaking, a piece of internal machinery not really intended for public use: a variable called `prior named object` which keeps track of what noun other words should agree with. It is not safe to use this variable except to clear it: `now the prior named object is nothing`. In a few situations, this prevents glitches in adaptive text.

	{*}"Relevant Relations"
	
	Section 1 - Procedure
	
	Rule for writing a paragraph about something (called item):
		now the current paragraph is { };
		say "[one of][regarding item]There [are] [an item] here[or][We] [can see] [an item] here[at random]. [run paragraph on]";
		follow the descriptive rules for the item;
		repeat with new item running through the current paragraph:
			now the prior named object is nothing;
			if new item is not the item:
				follow the descriptive rules for the new item;
		say paragraph break.
	
	Rule for writing a paragraph about someone (called chosen person):
		now the current paragraph is { };
		say "[one of][regarding chosen person][The chosen person] [are] here[or][We] [can see] [a chosen person] here[at random]. [run paragraph on]";
		follow the descriptive rules for the chosen person;
		repeat with new item running through the current paragraph:
			now the prior named object is nothing;
			if new item is not the chosen person:
				follow the descriptive rules for the new item;
		say paragraph break.
	
	The descriptive rules are an object-based rulebook.
	
	Definition: a container is see-through:
		if it is transparent:
			yes;
		if it is open:
			yes;
		no.
	
	A descriptive rule for a see-through container (called item) (this is the describe contents rule):
		describe the containment relation for item.
	
	A descriptive rule for a supporter (called item):
		describe the support relation for item.
	
	A descriptive rule for a person (called item):
		describe the wearing relation for the item.
	
	A descriptive rule for a person (called item):
		describe the carrying relation for the item.
	
	The current paragraph is a list of things that varies.
	
	Before printing the name of something (called mentioned target) while writing a paragraph about something:
		add the mentioned target to the current paragraph, if absent.
	
	To describe (R - a relation of objects) for (item - a thing):
		if a thing to which item relates by R is a thing:
			say "[The item with pronoun] [verb rendering applied to a random verb that means R] [the list of things to which item relates by R with indefinite articles]. [run paragraph on]"
	
	To decide which text is the rendering of (V - verb) (this is verb rendering):
		decide on "[adapt V]".
	
	To say (T - a thing) with pronoun:
		if T is the prior named object:
			say "[regarding T][They]";
		else:
			say "[The T]"
	
	Section 2 - Scenario
	
	The Space Elevator is a room. "Mercifully, there aren't any windows. The ability to see how far up you are would almost certainly make you ill."
	
	The luggage rack is a supporter in the Space Elevator. The suitcase is a closed openable container on the luggage rack. The bouquet is on the luggage rack.
	
	Clark is a man in the Space Elevator. Clark is carrying a box of cupcakes. Clark is wearing a t-shirt. The description of the box of cupcakes is "They're the latest confection from Red Velvet Planet, the Martian bakery."
	
	Persuasion rule: persuasion succeeds.

We can if we like then add alternate names for these relations that will be randomly swapped in some of the time. For instance:

	{**}To sport is a verb. The verb to sport means the wearing relation.
	
	To hold up is a verb. The verb to hold up means the support relation.
	
	Test me with "clark, drop the box / look / clark, take the suitcase / look / clark, get bouquet".

One might, hypothetically, imagine going even further than this and simply designating relations as either `important` or `unimportant` – perhaps changing the relation's designation at runtime. Relations are not themselves allowed to have properties, however.
