^^{mirrors (implementing): remembering a room description from the past}

	{*}"Mirror, Mirror"
	
	The Sorcerer's Workshop is a room. "The sorcerer's den is a dusty, whispering place. A grandfather clock with skeletal hands reads [the time of day in words]. The floorboards are stained where that porridge just wouldn't come out."
	
	The Apprentice's Pantry is east of the Workshop. "This is where the aproned apprentice traditionally makes the camomile tea, cleans out the jackdaw cages and furtively examines purloined artefacts."
	
	When play begins: erase the mirror.
	
	The player carries a magic mirror. The magic mirror has a text called the mirror vision.
	
	To erase the mirror: now mirror vision of the mirror is "The mirror is polished clean, and has no impression upon it."
	
	To say current room description: try looking.
	To expose the mirror:
		say "The mirror shines momentarily with a dazzling light.[paragraph break]";
		now mirror vision of the mirror is the substituted form of "The hazy image in the mirror preserves a past sight:[line break][current room description]All is distorted and yet living, as though the past and present are coterminous in the mirror."
	
	Understand "hold up [something preferably held]" or "hold [something preferably held] up" as holding aloft. Holding aloft is an action applying to one carried thing. Report holding aloft: say "You hold [the noun] aloft."
	
	Instead of rubbing the mirror: erase the mirror; try examining the mirror. Instead of holding aloft the mirror: expose the mirror.
	
	The description of the mirror is "[mirror vision of the mirror]".
	
	Test me with "look / examine mirror / hold up mirror / z / look / x mirror / rub mirror / east / hold mirror up / west / x mirror".
