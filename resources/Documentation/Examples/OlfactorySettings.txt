^^{An example bouquet of flowers}

While this isn't very interesting as IF, it runs through most of the adaptive-text tricks.

	{*}"Olfactory Settings"
	
	The Doghouse is a room. "Not so much a place as a state of being."
	
	The player carries a ticket to the opera, some papers, and a bouquet of flowers. The bouquet is ambiguously plural.
	
	Instead of eating something inedible, say "[The noun] [don't] seem likely to agree with [us] at all. [We][']d be wiser to leave [regarding the noun][them] alone."
	
	Instead of touching something: say "[regarding the noun][Those] [are] all prickly."
	
	Instead of smelling something: say "[Our] nose [regarding nothing][are] too weak to get much smell from [regarding the noun][those]."
	
	Instead of smelling the bouquet: say "[regarding the noun][They]['re] lovely."
	
	Instead of tasting something:
		say "Whew, [regarding the noun][are] [those] ever nasty!"
	
	Test me with "x ticket / eat it / eat them / touch it / touch them / smell it / smell them / taste it / taste them / x papers / eat it / eat them / touch them / smell them / taste them / x bouquet / eat it / eat them / touch them / smell them / taste them".
