	{*}"Wonka's Revenge"
	
	The Caribou Lodge is a room. "Hundreds of expectant faces are turned your way from every table." A lottery drum is in the Lodge. "Before you is the lottery drum[if we have spun the drum], ready to disgorge a ticket[otherwise], waiting to be spun[end if]." In the drum are a red ticket, an orange ticket, a yellow ticket, a green ticket, a blue ticket, a purple ticket, and a ticket of pure gold. The drum is closed and openable.
	
	Understand "spin [something]" as spinning.
	
	Spinning is an action applying to one thing.
	
	Check spinning: if the noun is an open container which contains something, say "[The list of things in the noun] would fly out." instead.
	
	Carry out spinning a container:
		shuffle the contents of the noun.
	
	Report spinning:
		if the noun contains something, say "You rattle [if the noun is transparent][the list of things in the noun][otherwise]the stuff[end if] in [the noun].";
		otherwise say "Nothing results of your shaking [the noun]."

Inform keeps track of the order in which things have been put into a container. If we want to change that order without the player's intervention, we can move the things ourselves.

	{**}To shuffle the contents of (basket - a container):
		let moves be the number of things in the basket;
		repeat with counter running from 1 to moves:
			move a random thing in the basket to the basket.
	
	After opening the drum when we have spun the drum for the first time:
		if something (called the pick) is in the drum:
			try searching the drum;
			say "[The pick] it is, then.";
			silently try taking the pick;
			if the pick is the ticket of pure gold, end the story finally;
			otherwise end the story saying "Oh well, better luck next time."
	
	Test me with "open drum / look in drum / close drum / spin drum / open drum".
