Example: * Disenchantment Bay 5
Location: Doors
RecipeLocation: Disenchantment Bay
Index: Disenchantment Bay 5. Cabin door and deck
Description: Disenchantment Bay: adding the door and the deck to our charter boat.
For: Untestable

We mentioned that there is a door out to the deck in our example. The following two sentences will create both the door and the other room:

	{*}The cabin door is south of the Cabin and north of the Deck. It is a door and scenery.

Now Inform has constructed a generic room called "Deck" to the south. It has neither a description nor any contents yet, but we could fix that in time. It does have a view of the glacier, though, since we defined the glacier view to be everywhere.
