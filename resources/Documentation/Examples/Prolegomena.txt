Index: Exact numbers replaced with vague quantifiers
Description: Replacing precise numbers with "some" or other quantifiers when too many objects are clustered together for the player to count at a glance.
For: Z-Machine

Room descriptions often make the player character out to be a bit of a savant, able to count whole stacks of items at a glance: ``You see 27 paper clips here.``

We can adjust this behaviour to our liking, though, with the printing a number... activity, as follows:

	{*}"Prolegomena"
	
	The Editor's Office is a room. The desk is a supporter in the Editor's Office.
	
	A red pencil is a kind of thing. 12 red pencils are on the desk.
	
	A letter is a kind of thing. 12 letters are on the desk. Understand "correspondence" as a letter.
	
	Rule for printing the plural name of a letter:
		if the listing group size is greater than 7, say "correspondence";
		otherwise say "letters".
	
	Rule for printing a number of something (called the target) when the listing group size is greater than 7:
		say "[one of]some [or]various [or]an assortment of [at random]";
		carry out the printing the plural name activity with the target.

This general rule can of course be overridden by more specific ones; for instance, if we want to take the opportunity to comment on the viewpoint character's appetite for instruments of correction:

	{**}Rule for printing a number of red pencils (called the target) when the listing group size is greater than 10:
		carry out the printing the plural name activity with the target;
		say " in nearly-sufficient quantity".
	
	Test me with "get two letters / look / get a pencil / i / get pencil / g / g / look / i / get all / i".
