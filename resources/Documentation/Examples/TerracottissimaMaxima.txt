^^{Understanding text}

Inform can also understand text properties:

	{*}"Terracottissima Maxima"
	
	A flowerpot is a kind of thing. A flowerpot has a text called pattern. Understand the pattern property as describing a flowerpot. The printed name of a flowerpot is usually "[pattern] flowerpot". The printed plural name of a flowerpot is usually "[pattern] flowerpots".
	
	The Herb Garden is a room. In the Herb Garden is a flowerpot with pattern "blue willow". In the Herb Garden is a flowerpot with pattern "striped". In the Herb Garden is a flowerpot with pattern "striped".
	
	Test me with "x blue willow / get striped / look".

This may not seem very much different from having the pattern be a kind of value â€“ except that texts can, of course, hold almost anything. Further exploration of these possibilities may be found in the chapter on [Advanced Text].
