  Library of the Dead
  This room -- little, dank, stone -- is filling with some miasma you do not quite dare breathe. It is imperative that you get out.
  
  A trapdoor in the ceiling is your only hope of escape.
  
  On the desk is a world's last manuscript of the Psychagogoi by Aeschylus.
  
  You can also see a box (in which is a shroud of Laertes) here.
