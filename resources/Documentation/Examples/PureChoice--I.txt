Here we might place our opening narration.

We could go on for several paragraphs, if we like. There's no need to make them separate lines of narration if we do not want to.

(1) I get the general idea.
(2) Cool. Now show me something else.

>I get the general idea.

Good.

Speaking of choices, the following two won't make any difference at all. The player's decision will immediately rejoin, leaving them only with the recollection of having made a choice in the first place.

(1) I will remember this.
(2) I will forget this almost immediately.

>I will forget this almost immediately.

Here, by contrast...

(1) This branch is actually significant.
(2) As is this one.

>This branch is actually significant.

You have passed through the left door.
