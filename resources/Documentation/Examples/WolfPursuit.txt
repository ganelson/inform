	Wolf Pursuit is a scene. Wolf Pursuit begins when play begins.
	
	Every turn during Wolf Pursuit, say "[one of]A twig snaps behind you![or]The wind howls in your ears.[or]You feel chilly.[at random]".

	When play begins:
		say "You have lost your spectacles, and the lamp, and can see barely further than the next tree. Roots keep trying to trip you, too..."

	The Dark Forest is a room. "You are mostly aware that you are not as alone here as you would like, and that the ground is uneven."
