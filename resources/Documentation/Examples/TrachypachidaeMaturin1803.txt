	The Doctor's Cabin is a room. "A dark, cramped triangle, like a slice of cake, except that its sharp end has been cut off: and so low that a moderately tall man would strike his head on the deck above if he were to stand upright. Every free surface is covered with sheets of best Venetian looking-glass, to increase the light filtering in. Long use and the carpenter's ingenuity have packed in a folding cot and table, and lockers are built into unlikely places: lockers filled with specimens, skeletons, sketches, drafts and serial letters." The jug is a bottle in the Doctor's Cabin. The jug contains a beetle. The description of the beetle is "The doctor assures you that it is a nondescript."
