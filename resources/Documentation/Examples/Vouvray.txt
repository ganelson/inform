The [Understanding] chapter lays out ways to change how the player can refer to objects, but we may not want to wait that long for some of the basic features. Here, for instance, is how to add synonyms that the player can use to refer to an entire kind of object:

	{*}"Vouvray"
	
	The Wine Emporium is a room. "Set aside, you rather suspect, for tourists: this chamber is barrel-vaulted stone, lined on each side with casks of aging wine. Discarded brochures here and there advertise Wine Tours of the Loire Valley in three different languages, none of them French."
	
	A cask is a kind of thing. A cask is always fixed in place. Understand "cask" or "barrel" as a cask. Understand "casks" or "barrels" as the plural of cask.
	
	The Vouvray cask and the Muscadet cask are casks in the Wine Emporium.
	
	Test me with "get barrels / get barrel / muscadet / x casks / x muscadet cask".
