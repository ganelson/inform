^^{Capitalised status line}

Not much is needed for this. The only noteworthy point is that it doesn't work by changing the left hand status line to `"[the player's surroundings in upper case]"`: it cannot do this because "the player's surroundings" is not a value. Instead, `"[the player's surroundings]"` is a text substitution sometimes printing the name of a room, sometimes printing "Darkness", and so on. We must therefore load it into a text first, and then apply "...in upper case".

	{*}"Capital City"
	
	Capital City is a room. East is Lower Caissons. South of Lower Caissons
	is San Seriffe. East of San Seriffe is a dark room.
	
	To say the player's capitalised surroundings:
		let the masthead be "[the player's surroundings]" in upper case;
		say the masthead.
	
	When play begins:
		now the left hand status line is "[the player's capitalised surroundings]".
	
	Test me with "e / s / e".
