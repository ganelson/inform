(People who reject categories of instruction; Virtue)
Defining certain kinds of behavior as inappropriate, so that other characters will refuse indignantly to do any such thing.

	{*}"Virtue"
	
	The Cloister is a room. Lady Teresa is a woman in the Cloister. Mother Margaret is a woman in the Cloister.

	Attacking someone is misbehavior. Kissing someone is misbehavior.

	Instead of asking someone to try misbehavior: say "[The person asked] stiffens, offended by your suggestion."
	
	Test me with "kiss margaret / margaret, kiss me".
