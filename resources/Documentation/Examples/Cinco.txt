^^{containers+kind+: referred to by contents}

It's fairly common that we want to be able to refer to a container in terms of what it has in it: a bottle of wine, a salt shaker, a chicken sandwich. The player is free to remove the contents again, and the object will go back to using its usual name:

	{*}"Cinco"
	
	Cinco de Mayo Fundraiser is a room.
	
	The taco shell is an edible thing in the Fundraiser. It is a portable container. It has carrying capacity 1.
	
	Understand "[something related by containment] taco" as the taco.
	
	Rule for printing the name of the taco shell while not inserting or removing:
		if the taco contains something (called filling), say "[filling] taco";
		otherwise say "taco shell";
		omit contents in listing.
	
	The player carries shredded beef. It is edible.
	
	The taking action has an object called source (matched as "from").
	
	Setting action variables for taking:
		now source is the holder of the noun.
	
	Report taking something from the taco shell:
		say "You gingerly pick [the noun] out of the taco shell." instead.
	
	Test me with "x taco / put shredded beef in taco / get taco / i / x shredded beef taco / get shredded beef / x shredded beef taco".
