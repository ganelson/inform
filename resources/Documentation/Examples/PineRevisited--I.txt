Spinning Tower
A remote corner of the old castle, reserved for spinning and weaving tasks.

Sleeping Beauty lies here, oblivious to your presence.

>(Testing.)

>[1] talk about sleep
You won't get much of a reply.

>[2] pour water on beauty
You pour out the jug of water on Sleeping Beauty. Sleeping Beauty wakes, shuddering. "Agh! I had a terrible dream about drowning and then-- Hey!"

Throughout the palace you can hear the other sounds of stirring and movement as the spell of centuries is broken.

"Ghastly nightmares," she remarks. You nod politely.

>[3] talk about sleep
"Sleep well?" you ask solicitously.

"Not really," she replies, edging away from you. So much for that angle.

>[4] z
Time passes.

"I, er," she says. "I hope I'm not supposed to marry you or something."

>[5] talk about marriage
"I was told I was going to marry you and inherit the kingdom," you say, apologetically. "Would that be very bad?"

"Oh, it's not you -- I'm seeing someone," she says, smiling quickly.

>[6] talk about time delay
"You've been up here for a hundred years," you say. An unpleasant thought occurs to you. "Was your young man in the castle somewhere?"

She shakes her head mutely.

She goes to the window and looks out at the now-fading thicket of briar. "That took a while to grow," she observes. "I was asleep longer than I thought."



    *** This is going to take some explaining. ***
