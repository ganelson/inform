Index: Raised supporter kind that conceals its contents
Description: Creating a raised supporter kind whose contents the player can't see or take from the ground.
For: Z-Machine

Suppose we want there to be some high shelves in our game, which the player can't get at unless they're standing on a prop of some kind. (This is a pretty hoary and over-used puzzle, but there may still be occasions when it becomes useful again.)

In order to resolve this, we want to set up a raised supporter kind. When something is on a raised supporter, it should be mentioned to the player only if the player is in the right position (i.e., standing on something) and otherwise omitted from the description entirely.

	Section 1 - Procedure
	
	A raised supporter is a kind of supporter.
	
	For printing a locale paragraph about a raised supporter (called the high place):
		if the player is on a supporter (called the riser):
			say "Up on [the high place] (and only visible because you're on [the riser]) [is-are a list of things on the high place].";
		otherwise:
			say "The [high place] is above you."

Note that here we don't continue the activity because we want to completely replace the normal behaviour of describing what is on supporters.

	{**}Definition: a thing (called target item) is out of reach:
		if the player is on a supporter, no;
		if the target item is on a raised supporter, yes;
		no.

Now we also need to prevent the player from interacting with things that are out of reach:

	{**}Before doing something:
		if the noun is out of reach or the second noun is out of reach:
			say "You can't reach from down here." instead.

...or restoring things to the shelves while the player is in the wrong position...

	{**}Instead of putting something on a raised supporter when the player is not on a supporter:
		say "You can't reach from down here."

And raised supporters shouldn't be searchable from the ground either:

	{**}Instead of searching or examining a raised supporter when the player is not on a supporter:
		say "You can't see from down here."

Finally, we need to tackle the case where the player types ``GET ALL FROM SHELF``, because we don't want to list the objects up there if the player can't even see them. We use a rule for deciding whether all includes in order to tell Inform not to consider items that can't be reached, and then we adjust the parser error so that it's a little more instructive than ``There are none at all available!``, which is what the response would otherwise be:

	{**}Disallowed-all is a truth state that varies. Disallowed-all is false.
	
	Rule for deciding whether all includes an out of reach thing:
		now disallowed-all is true;
		it does not.
	
	Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the nothing to do error and the player is not on a supporter:
		if disallowed-all is true:
			say "Whatever might be up there, you can't see or reach from down here.";
		otherwise:
			make no decision.
	
	A first action-processing rule:
		now disallowed-all is false.
	
	Section 2 - Scenario
	
	The Bottom of the Nursery is a room. "Ever since you ate that mysterious cake, you've been even shorter than usual."
	
	The high shelf is a raised supporter in the Nursery. It is scenery. On the high shelf are a kiwi-green ball and a stuffed dodo.
	
	The step-ladder is an enterable supporter in the Nursery. Understand "ladder" as the step-ladder.
	
	Test me with "x shelf / search shelf / get dodo / get all from shelf / stand on ladder / get all from shelf / search shelf / get off / put all on shelf / get all from shelf / stand on ladder / put all on shelf".
