^^{UNDO not mentioned in the final question}

By default, Inform reminds the player that they have the option of typing ``UNDO`` after a story-ending action. This is generally good practice, especially for the sake of novice players who might not be aware of this possibility otherwise, and might be frustrated by a loss they could easily step back from.

Just occasionally, though, we may decide that the player does not deserve any such notification:

	{*}"Finality"
	
	Cliff Edge is a room. "This narrow strip overlooks a gorge many hundreds of feet deep, at whose bottom is a river of molten lava. The walls of the gorge are lined with poison-tipped spikes. Furthermore, the birds that inhabit this valley spit balls of fire. Good thing you're safe up here."

The `Table of Final Question Options` determines what options are to be given to the player after the story ends. We can change what is mentioned there by altering the entries. (The example [Jamaica 1688] explains this table in more detail, and demonstrates some other things that we might do with it.)

	{**}When play begins:
		choose row with a final response rule of immediately undo rule in the Table of Final Question Options;
		blank out the final question wording entry.
	
	Instead of jumping:
		say "If you insist.";
		end the story.

And if we decided that we didn't want the player to be able to undo the command at all, we should add the use option

	{**}Use undo prevention.
	
	Test me with "jump".
