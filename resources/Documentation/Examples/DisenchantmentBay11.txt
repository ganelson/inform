Description: Disenchantment Bay: making a holdall of the backpack.
For: Untestable

If we wanted, we could make the player's backpack infinitely capacious, so:

	{*}The backpack is a player's holdall.

...And now whenever the player character is unable to hold everything, they will automatically stow some of their possessions therein.

This is only useful if the player doesn't have infinite carrying capacity, so perhaps we also need

	{*}The carrying capacity of the player is 3.

Perhaps mercifully, items which are worn are not counted against the player's carrying capacity. We might want to let them take advantage of that, too:

	{*}The backpack is wearable.

This capacity system makes a compromise between the realistic and the absurd: on the one hand, it acknowledges that people can't carry an infinite number of items in their hands, while at the same time providing a sack that can.

Many games will have no use for object-juggling of this kind at all; others will want to be much more rigorous about questions of capacity and volume. Fortunately, it is easy to leave the whole business out by assigning no carrying capacity to anything.
