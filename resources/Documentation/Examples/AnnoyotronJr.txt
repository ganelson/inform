	{*}"Annoyotron Jr"
	
	The Minivan is a room. The Open Road is outside from the Minivan. Pete is a man in the Minivan. "Pete [if the player has been in the Minivan for 3 turns]is starting to look bored[otherwise]is playing with his travel activity book[end if]."
	
	Every turn:
		if the player has been in the Minivan for 5 turns, say "'Are we there [if saying no]now?'[otherwise]yet?' asks Pete.[end if]"
	
	Instead of saying no:
		say "'Oh,' says Pete. There is a blessed, momentary silence."
	
	Instead of going to the Open Road:
		say "You leap to your death.";
		end the story.
