Example: * Ming Vase
Location: The noun and the second noun
RecipeLocation: Glass and Other Damage-Prone Substances
Index: ATTACK and DROP break fragile things
Description: ``attack`` or ``drop`` break and remove fragile items from play.
For: Z-Machine

In emulation of a certain annoying aspect of the original Adventure, in which there is a Ming vase that cannot safely be dropped:

	{*}"Ming Vase"
	
	A thing can be strong or fragile. A thing is usually strong.
	
	Instead of attacking or dropping a fragile thing:
		now the noun is nowhere;
		say "[The noun] breaks into thousands of pieces!"
	
	The Cave is a room. The Ming vase is carried by the player. The vase is fragile.

We could also implement an additional refinement from Adventure, that a fragile thing is safe if dropped when there is a cushion nearby.

	{**}The pillow is a portable supporter. It is carried by the player.
	
	Instead of dropping a fragile thing when the pillow is in the location: try putting the noun on the pillow instead.
	
	After putting a fragile thing on the pillow:
		say "You set [the noun] down gently on the pillow."
	
	Test me with "drop pillow / drop vase / get vase / get pillow / drop vase".

In this rule, the pillow is the second noun; if we had a general rule about setting fragile things on soft things, we could say "You set [the noun] down gently on [the second noun]." for the same effect.

If we wanted to be more refined, we would provide extra code so that breaking a container or a supporter would leave behind their contents. We will see how to do that later.
