	{*}"Interrogation"
	
	The X-Ray Vision Wand is carried by the player.
	
	Instead of waving the X-Ray Vision Wand:
		say "Disappointingly, nothing happens."
	
	Instead of waving the X-Ray Vision Wand when the player can see someone who is concealing something:
		say "The wand glows green. Immediately you see on the monitor [a list of things which are concealed by people who can be seen by the player]."
	
	After printing the name of a thing (called target) which is carried by someone while waving the wand:
		say " (carried by [a random person who carries the target])"
	
	The Interrogation Chamber is a room. "Despite its gothic name, this room is a rather civilized place for your work, with large plate-glass windows and a fitted carpet."
	
	A thing can be secret or obvious. A thing is usually obvious.
	
	Brian is in the Interrogation Chamber."Brian lounges against the wall." Brian carries a quantity of plastic explosive. The explosive is secret.
	
	Janine is in the Interrogation Chamber. "Janine toys nervously with a laptop bag." Janine carries a chocolate biscuit, a laptop bag, and a microfilm. The microfilm is secret. The laptop bag is wearable. In the bag is a laptop computer.
	
	Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of something: if the particular possession is secret, yes; otherwise no.
	
	Instead of examining someone: say "[The noun] is openly carrying [a list of unconcealed things carried by the noun]."
	
	Test me with "wave wand / examine janine / examine brian".
