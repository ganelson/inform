Example: ** Beekeeper's Apprentice
Location: Line breaks and paragraph breaks
RecipeLocation: Examining
Index: Examining everything at once
Description: Making the ``SEARCH`` command examine all the scenery in the current location.
For: Z-Machine

^^{examining+action+: everything at once}

We have to create a suitable action and say what it does, and to repeat what we do through all the scenery items. That needs material from subsequent chapters, but is quite ordinary Inform all the same:

	{*}"Beekeeper's Apprentice"
	
	Studying the vicinity is an action applying to nothing.
	
	Report studying the vicinity:
		if the location does not contain something which is scenery:
			say "There's little of interest in the [location]." instead;
		repeat with point of interest running through scenery in the location:
			say "[point of interest]: [run paragraph on]";
			try examining the point of interest.
	
	Understand "search" as studying the vicinity.
	
	The Yard is a room.
	
	The hive and the honey are scenery things in the Yard. The description of the hive is "The honeycombed hive is all around you, thrumming with life." The description of the honey is "Wax-sealed honey has been cached in many of the hexagonal nurseries."
	
	Test me with "search".

The reason for this example is to show the use of saying `"[run paragraph on]"`. It means we have output such as:

	> SEARCH
	hive: The honeycombed hive is all around you, thrumming with life.

	honey: Wax-sealed honey has been cached in many of the hexagonal nurseries.

Without the running on, the labels ``hive:`` and ``honey:`` would be separated from the descriptions following them, which would look a little odd.
