Description: Creating a more sensible parser error than "that noun did not make sense in this context".
For: Z-Machine

^^{Parser errors involving the any token}

The parser error "That noun did not make sense in this context" arises instead of "You can't see any such thing" when the player uses a command that could apply to any item in the game â€“ that is, a command such as

	Understand "go to [any room]" as going directly to.
	Understand "talk about [any subject]" as discussing.

...and so on. The idea here is that ``You can't see any such thing`` isn't a sensible rejoinder when the player doesn't really need to be able to see the object.

Nonetheless, ``That noun did not make sense...`` is itself a fairly dry and uninformative response, and we may want to override it to something more appropriate for the specific kind of context in which it might appear. For instance:

	{*}"WXPQ"
	
	WXPQ Studio is a room. "After about 2 AM, no one is listening anyway, so you can more or less make up whatever you like to fill the airwaves."
	
	John F Kennedy, Elvis, Ralph Nader, Tony Blair, and single-origin chocolate are things.
	
	Understand "talk about [any thing]" or "discuss [any thing]" as discussing. Discussing is an action applying to one visible thing.
	
	Carry out discussing:
		say "You babble for a while about your [one of]interest in[or]hatred of[or]passionate devotion to[or]conspiracy theory concerning[or]mother's secret love affair with[as decreasingly likely outcomes] [the noun]."
	
	Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the noun did not make sense in that context error:
		say "For once, you're at a loss for anything to say."
	
	Test me with "discuss Elvis / discuss Kennedy / discuss chocolate / discuss narratology vs ludology debate".

Note that this solution works as simply as it does because we only have one command in the game that can apply to an `"[any]"` token. If we had several, we'd need to distinguish between the parser error attached to ``DISCUSS`` and the parser error attached to ``GO TO`` (for instance). In that case, we might instead write something like

	Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the noun did not make sense in that context error:
	if the player's command includes "go":
		say "There's no such place you know how to get to.";
	otherwise:
		say "For once, you're at a loss for anything to say."
