Lounge
The Lounge is appointed with everything necessary to rest and relaxation: a vending machine, a potted palm, a stack of Entertainment Weekly issues from 1993, and -- your pride and joy -- a foosball game.

On the foosball game is a small white ball (still).

Joey is hunkered over the foosball handles on his side of the table.

>(Testing.)

>[1] turn handles
You madly rotate the tiny men on sticks! Hoorah! You hit the ball!

"What happened to the ball that was actually round?" Joey asks.

"You ate it. Remember?" The ball was eventually retrieved but not in a reusable condition.

"Oh yeah. To impress that girl Shannon. And now she never comes around any more." You don't ask why he thought Shannon wanted to see him eat a foosball. There are some things it's better not to know.

>[2] no
That was a rhetorical question.

Joey connects with your shot. Now the ball is approaching!

"Come on, come on, come on..." Joey bends down to view the table as though he can will the ball into the goal. 

>[3] turn handles
Thunk. You keep the ball from reaching its goal! Now it is still.

Joey fails to hit the ball in your direction. It remains still.

"I'm pretty sure the ball moved out of the way. Is that possible?"

You give him a funny look. "Yeah, I moved it with the telekinetic powers of my mind."

>[4] z
Time passes.

Joey hits the ball solidly down towards your goal. Now it is approaching.

"This could take a while," he says.

>Are you sure you want to quit?
