Example: * Corner of No and Where
Location: Longer extracts of Inform 6 code
RecipeLocation: The Status Line
Index: Status line with centered text, the hard way
Description: A status line which has only the name of the location, centered.
For: Z-Machine

Making major changes to display features, such as the construction of the status line, sometimes requires that we rely on Inform 6 in bulk; here is how we might produce the Trinity-style status line, with the location centered at the top center of the screen.

Note that this example _only_ works if the Settings for it are set to the Z-machine story file format: it does not work on the default Glulx setting, which has a different screen arrangement.

	{*}"Corner of No and Where"
	
	No is a room. Where is west of No.
	
	Rule for constructing the status line:
		print the location in the center of the status line;
		rule succeeds.
	
	To print the location in the center of the status line:
		(- PrintCenteredStatus(); -).
	
	Include (-
	
	Array printed_text --> 64;
	
	[ PrintCenteredStatus i j;
		@set_cursor 1 0;
		i = 0->33;
		spaces(i);
		@output_stream 3 printed_text;
		print (name) location;
		@output_stream -3;
		j = (i - (printed_text-->0))/2;
		@set_cursor 1 j;
		print (name) location;
		spaces j-1;
	];
	
	-)
	
	Test me with "w / e".

In fact, as we've already seen, many extra modifications to the display behaviour are possible using Basic Screen Effects.
