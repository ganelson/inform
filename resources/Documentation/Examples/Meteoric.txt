Description: A meteor in the night sky which is visible from many rooms, so needs to be a backdrop, but which does not appear until 11:31 PM.
For: Z-Machine

The game below begins at half past eleven, and one turn later, it's meteor time:

	{*}"Meteoric I"
	
	The time of day is 11:30 PM.
	
	At 11:31 PM:
		now the meteor is in the great outdoors;
		say "A meteor streaks across the sky.".
	
	The great outdoors is a region. The Spanish Balcony is east of the Inner Court. The Court and Balcony are in the great outdoors. Inside from the Court is the Swimming Pool.
	
	The meteor is a backdrop. Instead of doing something to the meteor, say "The meteor is no longer visible, now nothing more than a memory."
	
	Test me with "wait / wait / examine meteor / west / examine meteor / in / examine meteor".

Or for something a little slower-moving and with no after-image:

	{*}"Meteoric II"
	
	The time of day is 4:30 PM.
	
	At 4:31 PM:
		now Phobos is in the great outdoors;
		say "Phobos rises from the western horizon."
	At 10:06 PM:
		now Phobos is nowhere;
		say "Phobos sets over the eastern horizon."
	
	The great outdoors is a region. The Martian Balcony is east of the Inner Court. The Court and Balcony are in the great outdoors. Inside from the Court is the Heavy Water Swimming Pool.
	
	Phobos is a backdrop. Instead of doing something to Phobos, say "Phobos orbits a mere 6000km above you, which is practically touching range for astronomy. On the other hand, astronomy isn't all that practical."
	
	Test me with "wait / wait / examine phobos / west / examine phobos / in / examine phobos".

Though we should not really use Earthly time-keeping, since the Martian day is about half an hour longer than ours.
