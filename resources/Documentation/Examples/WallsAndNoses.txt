^^{Disambiguation question worded in a new way entirely}

Suppose we want our game to respond to ``EXAMINE WALL`` with ``In which direction?``, and to ``EXAMINE NOSE`` with ``Whose nose do you mean, Frederica's, Betty's, Wilma's or your own?``

For the case of ``EXAMINE WALL``, we need a way to determine whether every item being disambiguated is a direction. We'll start by making a `matched` adjective which will identify items being disambiguated:

	{*}"Walls and Noses"
	
	Eight-Walled Chamber is a room. "A perfectly octagonal room whose walls are tinted in various hues."
	
	Understand "wall" as a direction.
	
	Definition: a direction is matched if it fits the parse list.
	Definition: a room is matched if it fits the parse list.
	Definition: a thing is matched if it fits the parse list.
	
	Rule for asking which do you mean when everything matched is direction:
		say "In which direction?"

Checking the parse list requires a bit of behind-the-scenes work with Inform 6. Fortunately, you don't have to understand this entirely in order to use the rest of the example:

	{**}To decide whether (N - an object) fits the parse list:
		(- (FindInParseList({N})) -)
	
	Include (-
	[ FindInParseList obj i k marker;
		marker = 0;
		for (i=1 : i<=number_of_classes : i++) {
		while (((match_classes-->marker) ~= i) && ((match_classes-->marker) ~= -i)) marker++;
		k = match_list-->marker;
		if (k==obj) rtrue;
		}
		rfalse;
	];
	-)

Now that we've defined our `matched` adjective, we can use it for other purposes as well – even generating our own lists. Our second challenge was to respond to ``EXAMINE NOSE`` with ``Whose nose do you mean, Frederica's, Betty's, Wilma's or your own?``

Here we need to change the way the question is worded (not `which do you mean` but `whose nose do you mean`). We also have to the names of the noses as they're printed in this particular context, so that they don't repeat the word ``nose`` over and over. And – as a point of good English style – we also want ``your own`` nose always to be last on the list.

For this purpose we may want to use the `Complex Listing by Emily Short` extension, which allows us to print specially ordered lists. So:

	{**}Include Complex Listing by Emily Short.
	
	Wilma, Betty, and Frederica are women in the Eight-Walled Chamber. Understand "lady" or "woman" as a woman. A nose is a kind of thing. A nose is part of every person.
	
	Rule for asking which do you mean when everything matched is a nose:
		prepare a list of matched things;
		if your nose is an output listed in the Table of Scored Listing:
			choose row with an output of your nose in the Table of Scored Listing;
			now the assigned score entry is -1;
		say "Whose nose do you mean, [the prepared list delimited in disjunctive style]?"
	
	Rule for printing the name of a nose (called target) while asking which do you mean :
		if everything matched is a nose:
			if the target is part of a person (called owner):
				if the owner is the player, say "your own";
				otherwise say "[the owner][apostrophe]s";
		otherwise:
			make no decision.
	
	Understand "own" or "mine" as your nose.
	
	Test me with "x wall / north / x nose / mine".
