Description: Using the dialogue system to create reusable dialogue sequences in which the player can negotiate a complex trade.

In this expansion of Barter Barter, we use the dialogue system to provide the player with a menu-based way to trade objects with characters, including bargains that depend on characters' particular preferences and the relative value of the items offered.

	{*}"Barter Barter Barter"
	
	Chapter 1 - Setting
	
	The Trading Post is a room.
	
	Meriwether Lewis is a man in the Trading Post. He carries a fluffy handmade quilt and a bag of beans. The beans are edible.
	
	William Clark is a man in the Trading Post. He carries leather slippers, a journal, and a loaf of bread. The bread is edible. The slippers are wearable.
	
	The player carries an edible thing called a sandwich. The player carries a wearable thing called a hat. The player carries a wearable thing called a silver bracelet.
	
	Instead of examining someone: 
		say "[The noun] is carrying [the list of things carried by the noun]."
		
	Distaste relates one person to various things. The verb to dislike means the distaste relation.
	
	Clark dislikes the beans and the hat. Lewis dislikes the bread and the sandwich.
	
	Test me with "buy quilt / 1 / 1 / buy journal / 1".

We want to make the existing, but normally blocked, `thinking` and `giving` actions more substantial:

	{**}Chapter 2 - Idling moves
	
	The block thinking rule is not listed in any rulebook.
	The block giving rule is not listed in any rulebook.
	
	Report Lewis thinking:
		say "[Lewis] [one of]thinks for a minute[or]strokes his chin[or]mulls it over[at random]." instead.
	
Now for some actions which will handle the buying process.

	{**}Chapter 3 - Content

	Section 1 - Bartering basics
	
	Offer list is a list of things that varies.
	Acceptance list is a list of things that varies.
	The gift is a thing that varies.
	The goal item is a thing that varies.
	
	The barterer is a person that varies;
	
	Instead of buying something which is carried by someone:
		now the offer list is { };
		now the acceptance list is { };
		repeat with item running through things carried by the player:
			add item to offer list, if absent;
		now the barterer is the holder of the noun;
		now the goal item is the noun;
		perform the item purchasing beat instead.
		
	Refusing is an action applying to one thing.
	
	Carry out an actor refusing something:
		remove the noun from the offer list, if present.
		
	Partially accepting is an action applying to one thing.
	
	Carry out an actor partially accepting something:
		add the noun to the acceptance list, if absent;
		remove the noun from the offer list, if present.
		
	Accepting is an action applying to one thing.
	
	Carry out an actor accepting something:
		add the noun to the acceptance list, if absent;
		remove the noun from the offer list, if present;
		repeat with item running through the acceptance list:
			now the actor carries the item;
	
	Report an actor accepting something:
		say "You hand [the actor] [the acceptance list with definite articles].";
		now the acceptance list is { } instead.

To keep matters simple, we'll say that food items can be exchanged for one thing but that everything else is worth two things. In the wilderness, it's a seller's market. But if the barterer positively dislikes the item on sale, he'll let it go at any price.

	{**}Section 2 - Pricing
	
	To decide whether the total offer satisfies:
		if the barterer dislikes the goal item:
			yes;
		let proposed value be 0;
		repeat with item running through acceptance list:
			if item is edible:
				increase proposed value by 1;
			else:
				increase proposed value by 2;
		if gift is edible:
			increase proposed value by 1;
		else:
			increase proposed value by 2;
		let proposed cost be 0;
		if the goal item is edible:
			now proposed cost is 1;
		else:
			now proposed cost is 2;
		if proposed value is less than proposed cost:
			no;
		yes.

So here is the dialogue, where we make good use of action-based choices and flow markers. Note that the `offering beat` can flow into the `assessing beat` _and vice versa_, so we ought to be a little worried about the possibility of an endless regress. But it seems very unlikely that the barterers will get 20 deep in their negotiations. We could keep a count to prevent further wrangling at that point, but for the sake of simplicity this example doesn't do that.

	{**}Section 3 - Details (dialogue)
	
	(This is the item purchasing beat. Fully recurring.)
	
	Player: "'I'd like to buy [the noun],' you say."
	
	Barterer: "'What will you give me for it?' asks [the holder of the noun]." 
	
		-> perform the offering beat
		
	
	(This is the offering beat. Fully recurring.)
	
	-- (if the number of entries in the offer list is greater than 0) "Offer [the entry 1 in the offer list]"
	
		Player (before the barterer thinking; now the gift is entry 1 in the offer list): "'Can I offer you [the entry 1 in the offer list]?' you suggest."
	
		-> perform the assessing beat
		
		-> stop
	
	-- (if the number of entries in the offer list is greater than 1) "Offer [the entry 2 in the offer list]"
	
		Player (before the barterer thinking; now the gift is entry 2 in the offer list): "'How about [the entry 2 in the offer list]?' you ask."
	
		-> perform the assessing beat
		
		-> stop
	
	-- (if the number of entries in the offer list is greater than 2) "Offer [the entry 3 in the offer list]"
	
		Player (before the barterer thinking; now the gift is entry 3 in the offer list): "'I do have [the entry 3 in the offer list], if you want that.' you suggest."
	
		-> perform the assessing beat
		
		-> stop
		
	-- "Give up"
	
		Player: "'I guess I don't have what you need,' you say."
		
		Barterer: "'Apparently not,' says [the barterer] cheerfully. '[if the number of entries in the acceptance list is greater than 0]I guess you can hold on to [the acceptance list] for now, but[else]Feel[end if] feel free to come back later.'"
		
		-> stop
			
	
	(This is the assessing beat. Fully recurring.)
	
	Barterer (if the barterer dislikes the gift; after refusing gift): "'No thanks,' says [the Barterer]. 'Got anything else good?'"
	
		-> perform the offering beat
		
		-> stop
	
	Barterer (if the total offer satisfies; before accepting the gift): "'Sold!' says [the barterer]."
		
		Player (after the barterer giving the goal item to the player): "'Why, thank you,' you say."
		
		-> stop
	
	Barterer (after partially accepting gift): "'I'll take that in partial payment, but [the gift] isn't worth as much to me as [the goal item]. Got anything else good?'"
	
		-> perform the offering beat
		
		-> stop
