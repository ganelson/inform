Description: Implementing a ``FULL SCORE`` command which lists more information than the regular ``SCORE`` command, adding times and rankings, as an extension of the example given in this chapter.
For: Z-Machine

^^{scoring: >FULL SCORE}

Some games provide a ``FULL SCORE`` command that gives more information about the player's achievements than ``SCORE`` alone. Supposing we wanted to include a ``FULL SCORE`` in our game that gave the kind of score reading described in this chapter:

	{*}"Goat-Cheese and Sage Chicken"
	
	Use scoring.
	
	The story headline is "An interactive recipe"
	
	Table of Tasks Achieved
	Points	Citation	Time
	3	"sauteeing onions"	a time
	3	"reconstituting apricots"
	1	"flattening chicken"
	1	"unwrapping goat cheese"
	
	To record (T - text) as achieved:
		choose row with a citation of T in the Table of Tasks Achieved;
		if there is no time entry:
			now time entry is the time of day;
			increase the score by the points entry.
	
	Requesting the full score is an action out of world. Understand "full" or "full score" as requesting the full score.
	
	Carry out requesting the full score:
		if the score is 0, say "You have achieved nothing towards supper." instead;
		repeat through the Table of Tasks Achieved in reverse time order:
			say "[time entry]: [citation entry] ([points entry])."
	
	Table of Rankings
	Score	Rank
	0	"Rank Amateur"
	2	"would-be Bobby Flay"
	5	"Alton Brown"
	8	"Julia Child"
	
	The Kitchen is a room. The description of the Kitchen is "Equipped with many familiar friends: refrigerator, stove, oven; countertop; cabinet for pans and bowls, and a drawer for your tools."
	
	The stove is scenery in the kitchen. It is a supporter. The oven is a container. It is part of the stove. It is closed and openable. The stove's switch is a device. It is switched on. It is part of the stove. The  oven's dial is a device. It is switched off. It is part of the oven.
	
	A thing can be heatproof.
	
	Instead of putting something which is not heatproof on the stove when the stove's switch is switched on:
		say "You catch yourself just at the last minute: not a good idea to put [the noun] directly on the stove while it's turned on."
	
	Instead of switching on the stove, try switching on the stove's switch. Instead of switching off the stove, try switching off the stove's switch. Instead of switching on the oven, try switching on the oven's dial. Instead of switching off the oven, try switching off the oven's dial.
	
	Before switching on the oven's dial when the oven is open:
		say "(closing the oven so that it will heat properly)[command clarification break]";
		try closing the oven.
	
	The frying pan is a heatproof unopenable open container on the stove.
	
	The cabinet is a closed openable container in the kitchen. It is scenery. It contains an open unopenable container called a mixing bowl. It contains a portable supporter called a platter. An open unopenable heatproof container called a Calphalon baking dish is in the cabinet. The baking dish has the description "One of those marvelous pieces of kitchen equipment which goes on the stove or in the oven, as you will. The chief thing is never ever to touch it when it is hot, since the handles are metal and the heat retention excellent."
	
	The counter is a supporter in the kitchen. It is scenery. The kettle is a heatproof openable closed container on the counter. Some water is in the kettle.
	
	The water can be cool, warm, or boiling. The printed name of the water is "[water condition] water".
	
	The refrigerator is a closed openable container in the kitchen. It is scenery. Understand "fridge" as the refrigerator.
	
	An ingredient is a kind of thing.
	
	Some onions, some apricots, and some sage are ingredients on the counter. A chicken breast, an egg, and goat cheese are ingredients in the refrigerator.
	
	The goat cheese can be wrapped, snipped open, or unwrapped. The printed name of the goat cheese is "[goat cheese condition] goat cheese".
	
	The sage can be unwashed, clean, or julienned. The sage is unwashed. The printed name of the sage is "[sage condition] sage".

	The description of the Thurston Wolfe is "A Washington State Pinot Gris-Viognier, 2003. It is said to have 'peach aromas', and, startlingly, the untutored person can detect these without resorting to fantasy.
	
	(It is also supposed to possess a delicate perfume and a moderate body; the label author at least stopped short of 'good sense of humor and likes long walks on the beach')."
	
	Understand the commands "wash" and "rinse" as "clean".
	
	Instead of rubbing the unwashed sage:
		now the sage is clean;

	Instead of cutting the clean sage when the player is carrying the butcher knife:
		now the sage is julienned;
		say "You slice the sage into thin strips."
	
	Instead of cutting the unwashed sage:
		say "It came from the garden, so it won't have any strange chemicals on it, but you should still give it a rinse for dirt and bugs and so on before using it."

		now the goat cheese is unwrapped;
		record "unwrapping goat cheese" as achieved;
		say "Ah, success. The goat cheese is now free of its packet."
	
	Instead of peeling the wrapped goat cheese:
		say "It would help to have a pair of scissors or something -- the packet resists being torn."
	
	Instead of cutting the goat cheese:
		say "No need, at this point."
	
	Before cutting the wrapped goat cheese when the shears are not held by the player and the shears are visible:
		say "(first picking up the shears)[command clarification break]";
		try taking the shears.
	
	Instead of cutting the wrapped goat cheese:
		say "Something to cut with would be useful."
	
	Instead of cutting the wrapped goat cheese when the shears are held by the player:
		now the goat cheese is snipped open;
		say "You neatly snip through the packaging with the shears."
	
	Instead of examining the whole chicken breast:
		say "It is still entire and has yet to be pounded flat."
	
	Instead of examining the flattened chicken breast:
		say "It has been hammered to a thickness of about a half inch. (The recipe said a quarter inch but you're pretty sure it was joking. You have never been able to achieve a quarter inch.)"
	
	Instead of attacking the whole chicken breast:
		say "You need something heavy enough to flatten it with."
	
	Instead of attacking the whole chicken breast when the player is holding the wooden mallet:
		now the chicken breast is flattened;

		say "The onions sizzle in the pan."
	
	Every turn during Scorching Onions:
		say "The onions are past their prime and are getting blacker by the moment."

	Test sautee with "peel onions / cut onions / get onions / put onions in pan / get sage / wash sage / cut sage / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / get pan".
	
	Test apricots with "get kettle / open kettle / get apricots / put apricots in kettle / put kettle on stove / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait / wait".
	
	Test chicken with "open refrigerator / get chicken / open drawer / get mallet / hit breast".
	
	Test cheese with "get scissors / get cheese / unwrap cheese".
	
	Test me with "full score / test sautee / full score / test apricots / full score / test chicken / full score / test cheese / full score".

And... at that point you're a lot less close to being done than you think. The filling – onions, sage, apricot, and cheese – must be assembled and put in the chicken breasts; these tied up in string; each roll dipped in egg yolk and rolled in panko crumbs; these arranged in the Calphalon pan and baked. Then later, the whole retrieved from the oven, and the breasts transferred to a plate while we deglaze the pan and concoct the sauce with the chicken broth, wine, butter, etc. Then the chicken is sliced and plated, and the sauce poured over top. Usually one also wants a side dish or two. A number of things can go interestingly wrong in this process, of course, and implementing it would require, among other things, an intelligent management of all the possible mixtures that result.
