Example: * Battle of Ridgefield
Location: Printing the player's obituary
RecipeLocation: Ending The Story
Index: Death message replaced
Description: Completely replacing the endgame text and stopping the game without giving the player a chance to restart or restore.
For: Z-Machine

Occasionally, a piece of IF is sufficiently serious that it feels bathetic to offer the player the usual restore-restart-undo-quit options at the end. The following would replace "\*\*\* You have died \*\*\*" with a centered epitaph, then quit the game when the player hits a key.

This example relies on a standard extension to avoid any fancy programming:

	{*}"Battle of Ridgefield"
	
	Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.
	
	Ridgefield is a room.
	
	Instead of doing something when the turn count is greater than 1: say "Alas, you no longer have the strength."; end the story.
	
	Rule for printing the player's obituary:
		say paragraph break;
		center "In defense of American Independence";
		center "at the Battle of Ridgefield, April 27, 1777,";
		center "died Eight Patriots who were laid in this ground,";
		center "Companioned by Sixteen British Soldiers,";
		center "Living, their enemies,";
		center "Dying, their guests";
		say paragraph break;
		wait for any key;
		stop game abruptly;
		rule succeeds.
