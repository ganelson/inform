Description: The "another" adjective for rules such as "in the presence of another person".
For: Z-Machine

It is often useful to write action rules which apply only when the player is observed by a third party. `In the presence of a person`, however, will react even if only the player is in the room, because the player is, of course, a person as well.

A convenient way around this problem is to define an `another` adjective:

	{*}"Finishing School"
	
	The apple is an edible thing carried by the player.
	
	The Hall is a room. Miss Wicket is a woman in the Hall.
	
	The Dormitory is south of the Hall.
	
	Definition: a person is another if it is not the player.
	
	Instead of eating something in the presence of another person:
		say "Your mannerly upbringing prevents you from eating without a fork or knife in front of someone."
	
	Test me with "eat apple / south / eat apple".

If we did not have `another` here, Inform would interpret even the player as a possible schoolmarm, leading to such lines as ``yourself stares at you coldly...``. Clearly not quite the thing.
