Description: Clark Gable in a pin-striped suit and a pink thong.
For: Z-Machine

The following burlesque was considered too much for the tender readers of the [Things] chapter, since it involved explicit use of listing and persuasion:

	{*}"Hays Code"
	
	The Movie Set is a room. Clark Gable is a man in the Movie Set. "Clark leans on a polystyrene pillar, wearing [a list of unconcealed things worn by Clark] with his usual aplomb." Persuasion rule for asking Clark to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.
	
	Clark is wearing a pin-striped suit and a pink thong. Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of Clark: if the particular possession is the thong and Clark is wearing the suit, yes; otherwise no.
	
	Test me with "clark, remove suit / look / clark, remove thong / look".
