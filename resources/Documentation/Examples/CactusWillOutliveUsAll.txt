	{*}"Cactus Will Outlive Us All"
	
	Death Valley is a room. Luckless Luke and Dead-Eye Pete are men in the Valley. A cactus is in the Valley. Persuasion rule: persuasion succeeds.
	
	A person has an action called death knell. The death knell of Luckless Luke is pulling the cactus. The death knell of Dead-Eye Pete is Luke trying dropping the cactus.
	
	Before an actor doing something:
		repeat with the victim running through people in the location:
			let the DK be the death knell of the victim;
			if the DK is not waiting and the current action is the DK:
				say "It looks as if [the DK] was the death knell for [the victim], who looks startled, then nonexistent.";
				now the victim is nowhere.

If we leave it at that, then pulling the cactus will kill Luckless Luke but then say "Nothing obvious happens.", which seems like a bit of an anti-climax. So we add a special case response for that one:

	{**}After pulling the cactus when Luckless Luke was in the location:
		say "That's a real shame."
	
	Test me with "get cactus / drop cactus / luke, get cactus / luke, drop cactus / pull cactus / look".
