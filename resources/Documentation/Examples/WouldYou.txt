^^{Properties, checking for}

For instance, if we want to give some objects a flavour:

	{*}"Would you...?"
	
	The House is a room. The mouse is an animal in the House.
	
	The player carries some green eggs and a ham.
	
	A food is a kind of thing that is edible. Food has some text called flavor. The flavor of food is usually "Tolerable."

Things are, in general, not `edible` by default, so we have to give them that property in order to allow them to be eaten by the player. Here we've defined food to be `edible` by default, and we have given it a standard piece of flavour text.

	{**}The ham and the green eggs are food. The flavor of the green eggs is "Delicious!"
	
	After eating something:
		if the noun provides the property flavor, say "[the flavor of the noun][paragraph break]";
		otherwise say "It's [noun]-flavored."

Note that we use `if the noun provides a flavour...` to make sure that the property exists before attempting to use it. Otherwise, there is the risk that we will try to print a property that does not exist, resulting in errors in the game.

We will only get the `"It's [noun]-flavoured."` response if we successfully eat something that is not a food and does not have flavour text. To test this feature, let's suppose something that isn't exactly food but can theoretically be chewed on:

	{**}The player carries some paper. The paper is edible.
	
	Test me with "eat ham / eat green eggs / eat paper".
