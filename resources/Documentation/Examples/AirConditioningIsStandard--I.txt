  The blushing young lady stands near the door, tapping her foot nervously. She is wearing a sober grey gown (tellingly dishevelled) and a pair of black boots.

  The young lady murmurs something about the wilting heat, and undoes a button or two of her gown. The machinist's expression is comical, or would be, if you weren't annoyed.
