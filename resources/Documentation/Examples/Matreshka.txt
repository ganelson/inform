	Ransacking is an action applying to one thing.
	
	Check ransacking:
		if the noun is not the location, say "You can hardly search [the noun] from here." instead.
	
	Carry out ransacking:
		while the player can see a closed openable unlocked container (called target):
			say "[target]: [run paragraph on]";
			try opening the target.
	
	Report ransacking:
		say "You can see nothing further worth searching."
	
	The Russian Gift Shop is a room. In the Russian Gift Shop is a large wooden doll. It is closed and openable. In the large wooden doll is a medium wooden doll. It is closed and openable. In the medium wooden doll is a small wooden doll. It is closed and openable. In the small wooden doll is a tiny solid wooden doll.

And now we need to borrow from a later chapter for the command that will make this work:

	{**}Understand "search [any visited room]" as ransacking.
	
	Test me with "search gift shop".
