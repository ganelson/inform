Index: Describing action outcomes using a random choice of verb or describing the world state that results
Description: This builds on the Variety example to add responses such as "You are now carrying the fedora" that describe relations that result from a given verb, as alternate responses.
For: Z-Machine

^^{descriptions (displayed): action outcomes using a random choice of verb}

Some of our default actions establish relations between items in the world, and reporting on the relation (``You are now carrying the fedora``) can be a valid response alongside reporting on the action itself (``You take the fedora``).

To do this, we need to teach Inform explicitly which relations are the results of actions, then check this when reporting on actions:

		rule succeeds.
	
	After an actor doing something to something when a verb describes (the action name part of the current action) (this is the apply random verbs to describing actions rule):
		let current action name be the action name part of the current action;
		if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds and the current action name is a related action listed in the Table of Action Results:
			choose a row with the related action of current action name in the Table of Action Results;
			let R be the relation entry;
			let subject be the actor;
			let chosen object be the noun;
			say "[The subject] [are] now [present participle of a random verb that means R] [the chosen object].";
		else:
			say "[The actor] [verb rendering applied to a random verb that describes (the action name part of the current action)] [the noun].";
