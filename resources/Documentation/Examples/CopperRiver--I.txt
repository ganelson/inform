  Kitchen
  Your Aunt Fiona's kitchen looks as though it has been at the eye of a glitter storm. Fine, sparkling grit dusts every surface. The appliances are slightly askew, too, as though they hadn't quite settled after a vigorous earthquake.
  
  Aunt Fiona stands nearby. Or perhaps "stands" is the wrong word: she has been sort of puffed up in her own skin like a balloon, and is now propped in a corner of the room with her head lolling back.
  
  On the shelf is a tin of deflating powder.

  On the shelf is a tin of deflating powder.
  
  Aunt Fiona's eyes follow you, wide and desperate, but it doesn't look like she's able to do anything.

  Taken.

  Dropped.

  You can also see a tin of deflating powder here.
  
  >[5] look in cabinet
  There's nothing very useful here, only assorted dull items.
  
  >[6] get powder
  Taken.
  
  >[7] put powder on fiona
  You toss some of the powder in Aunt Fiona's direction, and with a sudden gaseous HUFF! she returns to her usual shape and size.
  
  "Well!" she says, brushing herself off. "That was bracing!"
  
  You give her an embarrassed smile, to apologize for not curing her faster.
  
  "At least they didn't get this," she says, producing from somewhere on her person a fresh-caught salmon. An odd pattern around its eye sockets makes it looks comically as though it wears spectacles. "It's the Salmon of Knowledge," she explains casually. "We just need to scale and cook it."

  >[15] get solution
  Taken.
  
  >[16] put solution on salmon
  With just a single squirt of the descaling solution (which confusingly has a picture of bathroom tiles on the label), you remove the scales from the salmon, leaving its pink flesh ready for preparation.
