Example: ** Happy Hour
Location: Listing nondescript items of something
RecipeLocation: Social Groups
Index: People listed as a group, with their possessions afterward
Description: Listing visible characters as a group, then giving some followup details in the same paragraph about specific ones.
For: Z-Machine

^^{characters (people): groups of people}

Often it is best to have an entire paragraph about the characters present in a room, but suppose we're narrating a large party with a lot of people moving around. In that case, it might be better to list everyone together, then add a few salient details by way of follow-up, like this:

	{*}"Happy Hour"
	
	Before listing nondescript items:
		say "You can see [a list of people who are marked for listing] here. ";
		repeat with named party running through people:
			now the named party is not marked for listing;
		let count be the number of visible other people who are carrying something;
		if count is 0:
			say paragraph break;
			continue the action;
		let index be count;
		repeat with holder running through visible other people who are carrying something:
			if index is count, say "[The holder]";
			otherwise say "[the holder]";
			say " has [a list of things carried by the holder]";
			decrement index;
			make delimiter index of count.

The next part could be simpler, but for rigour we will write it in such a way that it will work whether or not the serial comma is in use. This requires some extra work.

	{**}To make delimiter (index - a number) of (count - a number), continuing or halting:
		if index is 0:
			if continuing, say ". [run paragraph on]";
			otherwise say ".";
		otherwise if index is 1:
			if count is 2, say " and ";
			otherwise say "[optional comma] and ";
		otherwise:
			say ", ".
	
	To say optional comma:
		if the serial comma option is active:
			say ",".

And now the scene:

	{**}The Banquet Hall is a room. "A large cheery banner over the door (which, incidentally, vanishes when you approach it) reads: HELLO NEW INDUCTEES! WELCOME TO THE AFTERLIFE!"
	
	Fred, George, and Larry are men in the Banquet Hall. Fred carries a dry martini. Larry carries a cream puff. Matilda and Louise are women in the Banquet Hall.
	
	Definition: a person is other if it is not the player.
	
	Every turn:
		let wanderer be a random other person;
		let place be the holder of the wanderer;
		let next place be a random room adjacent to the place;
		let the way be the best route from the place to the next place;
		try the wanderer going the way.
	
	The Kitchen is west of the Banquet Hall. "Dominated by a pile of dirty plates which you imagine it will be someone's privilege to wash, later." Vanessa is a woman in the Kitchen. Vanessa carries a tray. On the tray is a salmon roll. The roll is edible.
	
	Test me with "z / look / g / g / g ".
