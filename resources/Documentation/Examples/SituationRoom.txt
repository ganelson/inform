For: Z-Machine

^^{Time told in 24-hour military style}

Though Inform normally prints times in AM/PM terms, it stores the hours and minutes as 24-hour time; so, if we like, we can easily extract that information again thus:

	{*}"Situation Room"
	
	The Situation Room is a room.
	
	To say (relevant time - a time) as 24h time:
		let H be the hours part of relevant time;
		let M be the minutes part of relevant time;
		say "[if H is less than 10]0[end if][H][if M is less than 10]0[end if][M]".
	
	When play begins:
		now the time of day is 6:09 PM;
		now the right hand status line is "[time of day as 24h time]".
	
	Test me with "z".
