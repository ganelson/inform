	{*}"One Short Plank"
	
	The East Jungle is a room. The plank bridge is west of the East Jungle and east of the West Jungle. The plank is an open unopenable door. "A precarious plank bridge extends [if the location is West Jungle]east[otherwise]west[end if] across the chasm." The description of the plank is "Extremely fragile and precarious."
	
	Instead of going through the plank when the player is carrying something:
		say "You step gingerly across the plank, which bows under your weight. But your meagre possessions are the straw which breaks the camel's back!";
		end the story.
	
	After going through the plank:
		say "You step gingerly across the plank, grateful that you're not burdened.";
		continue the action.
	
	There is a feather in the East Jungle.

But indeed, why stop there?

	{**}The gigantic stone ball is a thing in the West Jungle. It is pushable between rooms.
	
	Before going through the plank with something:
		say "Surely you jest." instead.
	
	Test me with "w / e / w / push ball e / e / get feather / w".
