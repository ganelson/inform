Example: **** Sand
Location: Before rules
RecipeLocation: Taking, Dropping, Inserting and Putting
Index: PUT and INSERT multiple objects with one command
Description: Extend ``PUT`` and ``INSERT`` handling to cases where multiple objects are intended at once.
For: Z-Machine

The player is not ordinarily allowed to ``PUT`` or ``INSERT`` multiple items in the same command, but this is easily changed with a couple of `Understand` instructions borrowed from many chapters later.

	{*}"Sand"

	Understand "put [things] in [something]" as inserting it into. Understand "put [things] on [something]" as putting it on.

	The Closet is a room.

	A lentil is a kind of thing. A black-eyed pea is a kind of thing. The closet contains 3 lentils. The Closet contains 14 black-eyed peas. The round tin is a container in the closet. The round tin contains 17 lentils. The square tin is a container in the Closet. The square tin contains 20 black-eyed peas.

	Sorting is a scene. Sorting begins when play begins. Sorting ends when all the lentils are in the round tin and all the black-eyed peas are in the square tin. When Sorting ends, end the story finally.

	When play begins: say "Thanks to your cruel stepmother, you're not going anywhere until the lentils and peas are sorted."

	Test me with "put peas in square tin / put lentils in round tin".
