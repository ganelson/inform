Example: ** Xerxes
Location: Amusing a victorious player
RecipeLocation: Ending The Story
Index: AMUSING menu shown at the endgame
Description: Offering the player a menu of things to read after winning the game.
For: Z-Machine

Building a menu is moderately tedious, so we will rely on the standard menu extensions provided. Thus:

	{*}"Xerxes"
	
	Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short. Include Menus by Emily Short.
	
	Table of Amusing Matter
	title	subtable	description	toggle
	"Cult Revisions"	--	"Did you try... [paragraph break]  banning the worship of Seth? [line break]  of Dionysus? [line break]  assigning all your priests to Re? [line break]  assigning male priests to Cybele? [line break]  assigning married priestesses to Hestia? [line break]  identifying one god as another (e.g., Isis and Hecate)? [line break]  identifying a mortal as a god (e.g., Alexander as Helios-Apollo)?"	--
	"Military Revisions"	--	"Did you try... [paragraph break]  allying a Greek city-state with the Persians? (try >MEDIZE) [line break]  playing Athens as a land-based power?"	--
	
	Rule for amusing a victorious player:
		now the current menu is the Table of Amusing Matter;
		now the current menu title is "Things to Try";
		carry out the displaying activity;
		clear the screen.

Omitting about a half million words from this rigorous and educational but nonetheless enthralling simulation of centuries of history, culture, and religion, we will skip directly to:

	{**}Athens is a room.
	
	Use scoring.
	
	Every turn:
		if the score is greater than 10000, end the story finally.
	
	When play begins: now the score is 10001.
	
	Test me with "z".
