  Done.

  "The available program is CHOCOLATE."

  "Running CHOCOLATE," Robo confirms.

  You see nothing special about Robo.
  
  Robo watches you examining Robo, its yellow eyes lamp-like and observant.
  
  >[21] x me
  As good-looking as ever.
  
  Robo watches you examining yourself, its brushed-copper handlebar moustaches twitching.

  Robo is now standing by.
  
  >[23] robo, list programs
  "The available programs are VANILLA and CHOCOLATE."

  The script of VANILLA is: Robo taking the blue cylinder, Robo taking inventory, Robo dropping the blue cylinder, Robo examining Robo and Robo examining yourself.
  
  >[25] robo, run vanilla
  "Running VANILLA," Robo confirms.
  
  Robo needs several attempts to get its metal fingers around the blue cylinder -- they are not designed for grasping small objects elegantly. But at last it succeeds.
  
  >[26] z
  Time passes.
  
  Robo looks through his possessions.
  
  >[27] z
  Time passes.

  >[28] robo, delete vanilla
  "ERROR: programs may only be deleted while Robo is in stand-by mode."
  
  Robo examines each of its hands in turn, then each of its legs (bending over mostly double in the middle to do this).
  
  >[29] robo, stop
  Robo is now standing by.

  The script of VANILLA is: Robo taking the blue cylinder, Robo taking inventory, Robo dropping the blue cylinder, Robo examining Robo and Robo examining yourself.

  "The available program is CHOCOLATE."
