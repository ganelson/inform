^^{Travel requiring a vehicle}

Let's say that our protagonist is about to flee. Obviously, they can't make the journey on foot; they need transportation.

Note that this example requires the extension `Rideable Vehicles by Graham Nelson`, and will only work if this is installed. It can be downloaded from the Public Library with the Inform app.

	{*}"Peugeot"
	
	Include Rideable Vehicles by Graham Nelson.
	
	The Lot is a room. The ten-speed bike is a rideable vehicle in the Lot.

We make the ten-speed bike a rideable vehicle because we want to say that the player is on it rather than in it. Then our other room:

	{**}Cambridge is east of the Lot.

And now we borrow from the [Basic Actions] chapter to prevent travel without the proper equipment:

	{**}Instead of going to Cambridge when the player is not on the ten-speed bike:
		say "It's a long journey to Cambridge: you'll never make it on foot."
	
	After going to Cambridge:
		say "You begin pedalling determinedly.";
		continue the action.
	
	Test me with "e / get on ten-speed bike / e".
