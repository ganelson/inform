  Fort James
  The enclosure of Fort James is a large, roughly hexagonal court walled with heavy stone.  The walls face the entrance to Port Royal Harbour, and the battery of guns is prepared to destroy any enemy ship arriving.

  Thames Street End
  The ill-named Thames Street runs from here -- at the point of the peninsula -- all the way east among houses and shops, through the Fish Market, edging by the round front of Fort Carlisle, to the point where the town stops and there is only sandy spit beyond. Lime Street, wider and healthier but not as rich, runs directly south, and to the north the road opens up into the courtyard of Fort James.

  Water Lane
  Here Thames Street -- never very straight -- goes steeply southeast for a portion before continuing more directly to the east.
  
  Water Lane runs south toward Queen Street, and facing onto it is the New Prison -- which, in the way of these things, is neither.  It did serve in that capacity for a time, and in a measure of the villainy which has been usual in Port Royal from its earliest days, it is nearly the largest building in the town.

  Thames Street at the Wherry Bridge
  To the southwest is the fishmarket; directly across the street is the entrance to a private alley through a brick archway.

  Private Alley
  You're just outside the tavern the Feathers. To the north, under a pretty little archway, is the active mayhem of Thames Street, but the alley narrows down to a dead end a little distance to the south.

  Feathers
  Newly built with brick, replacing the older Feathers tavern that used to stand here. It sells wines in quantity, as well as serving them directly, and the goods are always of the best quality. There's a room upstairs for those wanting to stay the night.
