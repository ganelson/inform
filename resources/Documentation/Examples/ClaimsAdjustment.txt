Description: An instant camera that spits out photographs of anything the player chooses to take a picture of.
For: Z-Machine

We start by creating a camera and a photograph object. As usual when we want to have a kind of object that can be dispensed in bulk, we start off with a bunch of identical instances of the object out of play (in this case, kept in an out-of-play container called `film roll`); we can then move them into play and give them characteristics when they're needed.

Each photograph can depict exactly one thing – we're assuming that the player is not a landscape photographer here – so we create a relation to indicate what is shown by each photograph. We'll then use that relation to determine how photographs are described, named, and parsed:

	{*}`Claims Adjustment`
	
	A photograph is a kind of thing. 36 photographs are in the film roll.
	
	Appearance relates one thing to various photographs. The verb to be shown by means the appearance relation.
	
	The description of a photograph is usually "It shows [a random thing which is shown by the item described]."
	
	Understand "of [something related by reversed appearance]" as a photograph.

This allows the player to refer to any photograph by its subject: useful if we have a large number of them.

Now we create an action to let the player use the camera and generate these photograph objects:

	{**}The player carries a cheap instant camera.
	
	Understand "photograph [something] with [camera]" as photographing. Understand "photograph [something] with [something preferably held]" as photographing. Photographing is an action applying to one visible thing and one carried thing, requiring light.
	
	The photographing action has an object called the selected film.
	
	Setting action variables for photographing:
		let N be a random photograph in the film roll;
		now the selected film is N.
	
	Check photographing:
		if the second noun is not the camera, say "You need a camera for that purpose." instead.
	
	Check photographing:
		if the noun is the camera, say "Sadly impossible." instead.
	
	Check photographing:
		if the selected film is nothing, say "You're out of film." instead.
	
	Carry out photographing:
		now the noun is shown by the selected film;
		move the selected film to the player.
	
	Report photographing:
		say "Your camera instantly spits out [a selected film]."

Now we use two activities from the [Activities] chapter to describe the photographs to the player more elegantly:

	{**}After printing the name of a photograph (called target):
		say " of [a random thing which is shown by the target]".
	
	After printing the plural name of a photograph (called target):
		let N be the holder of the target;
		say " of [a list of things which are shown by photographs which are held by N]";
		if the number of things which are shown by photographs which are held by N is greater than one, say " (variously)".

And finally we provide a brief scenario to give the player something to take pictures of:

	{**}The Treasure Room is a room. "Despite the fancy name, this is no more than a closet -- albeit a closet with its own special circuit on the house alarm."
	
	The Treasure Room contains a small Degas, a Ming vase, and a collection of South African krugerrands. The player is carrying insurance forms, a first-class stamp, and a security envelope.
	
	The description of the forms is "Completely filled out in black ink in block letters: now all you need to do is attach photographic evidence of the objects you wish to insure."
	
	Test me with "photograph degas / i / photograph degas / i / x photograph of degas / photograph me / x photograph of me / i / photograph vase / photograph camera / photograph collection / g / i / test more".
	
	Test more with "x photograph of collection / x photograph of krugerrands / x photograph of collection of south african krugerrands / photograph photograph of degas / x photograph of photograph of degas".
