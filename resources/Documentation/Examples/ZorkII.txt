Example: * Zork II
Location: Random choices of things
RecipeLocation: Map
Index: Carousel Room from which exits lead to random locations
Description: A "Carousel Room", as in Zork II, where moving in any direction from the room leads (at random) to one of the eight rooms nearby.
For: Z-Machine

All we need to do is select the player's destination at random:

	{*}"Zork II"
	
	The Carousel Room is a room.
	
	Instead of going from the Carousel Room:
		move the player to a random adjacent room.

To avoid infringing the original game too much, let's try a somewhat different setting:

	{**}The Games of Chance is north of the Carousel Room. The Haunted Funhouse is northwest of the Carousel Room. The Ferris Wheel is east of the Carousel Room. The Topsy-Turvy is northeast of the Carousel Room. The Reproduction Henge is south of the Carousel Room. The Women's Toilet is southwest of the Carousel Room. The Men's Toilet is southeast of the Carousel Room. The Cotton Candy Shop is west of the Carousel Room.
	
	Test me with "s".

And the following means that the test runs consistently even though the numbers are theoretically random. To make them truly random, remove this line.

	{**}When play begins, seed the random-number generator with 1234.

Or if we want to add the refinement that the Carousel Room can be switched off:

	{*}"Zork II"
	
	The Carousel Room is a room. The spinning machine is a switched on device in the Carousel Room.

And then

	{**}Instead of going from the Carousel Room when the spinning machine is switched on:
		move the player to a random adjacent room.
	
	The Games of Chance is north of the Carousel Room. The Haunted Funhouse is northwest of the Carousel Room. The Ferris Wheel is east of the Carousel Room. The Topsy-Turvy is northeast of the Carousel Room. The Reproduction Henge is south of the Carousel Room. The Women's Toilet is southwest of the Carousel Room. The Men's Toilet is southeast of the Carousel Room. The Cotton Candy Shop is west of the Carousel Room.
	
	Test me with "turn off machine / s / n / turn on machine / s".
	
	When play begins, seed the random-number generator with 1234.
