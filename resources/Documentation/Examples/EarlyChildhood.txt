Description: A child's set of building blocks, which come in three different colours - red, green and blue - but which can be repainted during play.
For: Z-Machine

^^{Duplicated blue, red and green building blocks}

This would be a one-star example if it were not for the repainting:

	{*}"Early Childhood 1"
	
	A building block is a kind of thing. A red block, a blue block and a green block are kinds of building block.
	
	The Nursery is a room. In the Nursery are six red blocks, four blue blocks and a green block.
	
	Test me with "look / get red block".

But a kind cannot change during play, so this will not do. Instead, the colour will have to be a property of the block. So we might first try this:

	{*}"Early Childhood 2"
	
	Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block has a colour. A block is usually blue.
	
	The Nursery is a room. In the Nursery are six red blocks, four blue blocks and a green block.
	
	Test me with "look / get red block".

Which is fine, so far as it goes, but the colour property is not at all visible to the player, who simply sees ``eleven blocks``. We thought of colour as being something outwardly apparent, but Inform does not know this. To achieve a better effect, we will need features from distant chapters. The first is an `activity` called `printing the name of`:

	{*}"Early Childhood 3"
	
	Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block has a colour. A block is usually blue. Before printing the name of a block: say "[colour] ". Before printing the plural name of a block: say "[colour] ".
	
	The Nursery is a room. In the Nursery are six red blocks, four blue blocks and a green block.
	
	Test me with "look / get red block".

This too, however, is unsatisfactory. The individual blocks are correctly described, but we are unable to distinguish them during play: we cannot type ``TAKE A GREEN BLOCK``, for instance. And because the blocks are indistinguishable in play, they are still massed together as ``eleven blocks`` in room descriptions. We need to go one step further:

	{*}"Early Childhood 4"
	
	Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, blue and green. A block is a kind of thing. A block has a colour. A block is usually blue. Before printing the name of a block: say "[colour] ". Before printing the plural name of a block: say "[colour] ". Understand the colour property as describing a block.
	
	The Nursery is a room. In the Nursery are six red blocks, four blue blocks and a green block.

And now everything works nicely: the blocks are grouped by colour, and can be referred to by colour, and we can even change the colour of an individual block during play, using a bit of extra trickery from later:

	{**}Understand "paint [something] [colour]" as painting it. Painting it is an action applying to one thing and one colour. Check painting it: if the noun is not a block, say "Paints are only for blocks." instead. Carry out painting it: now the colour of the noun is the colour understood. Report painting it: say "The block is now [the colour of the noun]."
	
	Test me with "get red block / get blue block / g / i / look / paint blue block red / i / look / paint me red".
