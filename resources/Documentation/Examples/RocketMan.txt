^^{case changing: for text produced by to say phrases}

We can now change the case of any text produced by a `to say...` phrase. This is often useful when we would like to make use of a standard say phrase in some new context. Say, for instance, that we would like to `"[is-are the list...]"` in a context that needs the first letter to be capitalised.

We could write a new say phrase, such as "to say is-are the list of (Nâ€“a description of objects) in sentence capitalisation"; but there is an easier way, and that is to set a text variable to the output of the to say phrase, and then print that text in the case of our choice.

For example:

	{*}"Rocket Man"
	
	Instead of going somewhere from the spaceport when the player carries something:
		let N be "[is-are the list of things carried by the player] really suitable gear to take to the moon?" in sentence case;
		say "[N][paragraph break]".
	
	The Spaceport is a room. North of the Spaceport is the Rocket Launch Pad. The player carries a stuffed bear, a chocolate cookie, and a book.
	
	The description of the book is "It is entitled [italic type]Why Not To Take [sentence cased inventory] To The Moon[roman type]."
	
	To say sentence cased inventory:
		let N be "[a list of things carried by the player]" in title case;
		say "[N]".
	
	Test me with "n / x book".
