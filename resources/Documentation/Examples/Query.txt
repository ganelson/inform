^^{Responding to questions starting with WHO, WHAT, etc.}

First, we create a single `"[query]"` token so that we can capture all instances of such sentences in a single line:

	{*}"Query"
	
	Blank Room is a room.
	
	Understand "who" or "what" or "when" or "where" or "why" or "how" or "who's" or "what's" or "when's" or "where's" or "why's" or "how's" as "[query]".
	
	Understand "[query] [text]" as a mistake ("[story title] understands commands, such as '[command prompt]examine [a random thing that can be seen by the player]', but not questions. For more instructions, type HELP.").
	
	Test me with "who am I? / who are you? / where is this place?".

Now the game will respond to all questions novice players might type with this reminder to look for help information.
