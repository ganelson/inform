Index: Phrase to repeat a rule
Description: Writing a phrase, with several variant forms, whose function is to follow a rule several times.
For: Z-Machine

As we see in the example here, it is possible to use slashed variations in more than one place in a phrase, and to offer a number of separate forms. The main rule of thumb to remember is that value inputs for the phrase should always be separated by some text; so

	To do/follow (chosen rule - a rule) exactly/precisely/just/-- (N - a number) time/times:
		....

would cause a problem when we tried to call it with

	follow the throat-clearing rule 2 times.

In general, we probably don't need to make our phrase definitions quite so flexible as this, but it's a good idea to account for "a" vs. "the", and for the possibility of using singular and plural forms, especially when writing extensions or other source to be shared.

	{*}"Ahem"
	
	To do/follow (chosen rule - a rule) exactly/precisely/just (N - a number) time/times:
		repeat with index running from 1 to N:
			follow chosen rule.
	
	This is the throat-clearing rule:
		say "'Ahem,' says [a random visible person who is not the player]."
	
	After waiting:
		do the throat-clearing rule just one time.
	
	Instead of listening:
		follow the throat-clearing rule precisely three times.
	
	Instead of smelling:
		follow the throat-clearing rule exactly 2 times.
	
	Chateau Marmont is a room. Tom, Jack, Zsa-Zsa, and Wilma-Faye are people in the Chateau. Zsa-Zsa and Wilma-Faye are women.
	
	Test me with "wait / smell / listen".
