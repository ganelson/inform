Description: Cycling through a sequence of scenes to represent day and night following one another during a game.
For: Z-Machine

Suppose we want to have a sequence of nights and days in our game, with one scene to govern each daylight condition.

	{*}"Night and Day"
	
	The sun is a backdrop. It is everywhere. The description is "Currently out of sight."
	
	Night is a recurring scene. Night begins when play begins. Night begins when Dusk ends. Night ends when the time since Night began is 3 minutes.

Notice that our two conditions for the beginning of Night are not in conflict: it will be night-time when the game begins, and then night will also recur every time the Dusk scene ends.

	{**}When Night begins:
		say "The sun falls below the horizon and the temperature drops abruptly to well below zero.";
		now the description of the sun is "Currently out of sight."
	
	Dawn is a recurring scene. Dawn begins when Night ends. Dawn ends when the time since Dawn began is 1 minute.
	
	When Dawn begins:
		say "The sun appears on the horizon.";
		now the description of the sun is "It is tiny and weak.".
	
	Day is a recurring scene. Day begins when Dawn ends. Day ends when the time since Day began is 3 minutes.
	
	When Day begins:
		say "The sun is now properly up."
	
	Dusk is a recurring scene. Dusk begins when Day ends. Dusk ends when the time since Dusk began is 1 minute.
	
	When Dusk begins:
		say "The sun has passed across the sky and is on the verge of setting."
	
	Cratered Landscape is a room. "The ground here is [if Night is happening]dim silver, with the craters visible as darker splotches[otherwise]the color of dried blood; here and there it is also rippled by impact craters[end if]. The horizon curves visibly."
	
	Test me with "z / z / z / look / x sun / z / z / z / z / z / z / z".

If we run this example and then have a look at the scenes index, we'll see that the cycle is listed through thus:

	Night (recurring)
		Dawn (recurring)
			Day (recurring)
				Dusk (recurring)
					Night

with the second "Night" in italics, to indicate that it is a repetition of the same scene that has already been listed above.
