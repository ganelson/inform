Index: HTML-style italic and boldface tags
Description: Making paired italic and boldface tags like those used by HTML for web pages.
For: Glulx

HTML uses angled brackets to achieve effects, and places italicised text between <i> and </i> tags; and similarly boldface between <b> and </b>. We can mimic this very easily by setting each up as a segmented substitution:

	{*}"Chanel Version 1"
	
	To say i  -- beginning say_i -- running on: (- style underline; -).
	To say /i  -- ending say_i -- running on: (- style roman; -).
	To say b -- beginning say_b -- running on: (- style bold; -).
	To say /b -- ending say_b -- running on: (- style roman; -).
	
	Place Vendôme is a room. "[i]Fashion fades, only style remains the same[/i] ([b]Coco Chanel[/b]). And this elegant drawing-room, once a milliner's shop, is a case in point."
	
	Instead of going nowhere, say "[i]Don't spend time beating on a wall, hoping to transform it into a door.[/i] ([b]Coco Chanel[/b]) This one is a wall.".
	
	Test me with "look / e".

We have had to use square instead of angle brackets, but then, "in order to be irreplaceable one must always be different" (Coco Chanel).

(Marking these as substitutions which run on prevents unexpected paragraph breaks if they should appear immediately after the end of a sentence.)
