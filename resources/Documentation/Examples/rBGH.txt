Description: The player character's height is selected randomly at the start of play.

As with ordinary numbers, we can choose random units when this is useful:

	{*}"rBGH"
	
	The Pharmaceutical Testing Facility is a room. "A [if the player is short]large [end if][if the player is tall]cramped [end if]white space with sterile counters and a[if the player is tall]n uncomfortable little[end if] stool. There is also a mirror, behind which someone must be watching you. But you can't see through to that."
	
	A counter, a one-way mirror, and a stool are scenery in the Facility. The stool is an enterable supporter. The counter supports a plate.
	
	Height is a kind of value. 5 feet 11 inches specifies a height. 5'11 specifies a height. A person has a height.
	
	Definition: a person is tall if its height is 6 feet 0 inches or more.
	
	Definition: a person is short if its height is 5 feet 4 inches or less.
	
	When play begins:
		now the height of the player is a random height between 5 feet 2 inches and 6 feet 4 inches;
		now the right hand status line is "[height of player]".
	
	Instead of examining the player:
		say "You, Test Subject, are [height of the player] tall."
	
	The growth pill is a kind of thing. A growth pill is always edible. The description is usually "It is leaf-green and has a reassuring logo of a curling vine on the side. Nothing to worry about, nothing at all." Two growth pills are on the plate.
	
	After eating the growth pill:
		increase the height of the player by 0 feet 6 inches;
		say "Your spine does something frightening and painful, and you find yourself looking down on the room from a wholly new angle.";
		try looking.
	
	Test me with "examine me / eat pill / examine me / eat pill / examine me".
