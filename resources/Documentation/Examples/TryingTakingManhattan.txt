Example: *** Trying Taking Manhattan
Location: Making actions work for other people
RecipeLocation: Inventory
Index: INVENTORY revised for other characters
Description: Replacing the inventory reporting rule with another which does something slightly different.
For: Z-Machine

Inform has built-in commands for other people, and sometimes we may want to adjust the way these work without completely disabling and replacing the command. Suppose, for instance, that instead of

	Kermit the Frog looks through his possessions.

we'd like someone taking inventory to report what they have, thus:

	Kermit the Frog says, "I seem to be carrying a microphone and wearing a hat and a trenchcoat."

To do this, we could replace the built-in report rule with a different one.

	{*}"Trying Taking Manhattan"
	
	The loud inventory rule is listed instead of the report other people taking inventory rule in the report taking inventory rules.
	
	This is the loud inventory rule:
		unless the player is the person asked:
			say "[The person asked] says, 'I seem to be carrying [a list of things carried by the person asked][if the person asked is wearing something] and wearing [a list of things worn by the person asked][end if].'"
	
	Persuasion rule for asking someone to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.
	
	Grand Central Station is a room. "Here you are in New York, New York. Any minute now someone is going to burst into song."
	
	Kermit the Frog is a man in Grand Central Station. "Kermit the Frog stands nearby, enjoying being green." Kermit is wearing a hat and a trenchcoat. He is carrying a microphone.
	
	Test me with "inventory / kermit, inventory".
