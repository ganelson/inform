Here we have a destruction action that allows the player to break any fragile items. Once destroyed, these things are removed from play, but we can still refer to them: they are now off-stage. This makes it easy for our sulking character to list the ones that have been destroyed:

	{*}"Spring Cleaning"
	
	A thing can be tough or fragile. A thing is usually tough.
	
	Instead of attacking something fragile:
		say "You smash [the noun] to smithereens!";
		now the noun is nowhere.
	
	A knick-knack is a kind of thing which is fragile.
	
	Every turn when a knick-knack is off-stage and Granny Blue can see the player:
		say "'Ohh,' whimpers Granny to herself softly. 'How I will miss [the list of off-stage knick-knacks]!'"
	
	The Parlor is a room. Granny Blue is a woman in the Parlor. A china lamb, a porcelain milkmaid, a frolicking Dutch cow, and a crystal unicorn are knick-knacks in the Parlor.
	
	Test me with "break lamb / break milkmaid / break cow / break unicorn".
