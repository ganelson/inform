  Donut Shop
  Vibrantly decorated in donut colors: pink, brown, and cream.
  
  Ogg is slumped in the corner. He wears a nametag which says "HELLO MY NAME IS OG."
  
  The gleaming donut case contains some cake donuts, some jelly donuts and some apple fritters.
  
  You can also see a mesh basket (closed) (in which is a silver key) here.
