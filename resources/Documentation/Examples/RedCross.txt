	Diagnosing is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand "diagnose [something]" as diagnosing.
	
	Check diagnosing:
		if the noun is not a person, say "Only people can have diagnoses." instead.
	
	Carry out diagnosing:
		say "You're not a medical expert."
	
	Instead of diagnosing the player:
		say "You feel fine!"
	
	The Clinic is a room. Fred is a man in the Clinic. The player carries a tongue-depressor.
	
	Test me with "diagnose me / diagnose fred / diagnose tongue-depressor".
