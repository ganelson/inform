Village Square
This is the center of the village where you live. Sidekick frequently spends time with you here.

Sidekick: "Let's talk about our daily reality. It's going along in a pretty stable fashion, wouldn't you say? Are we happy or not?"

(1) Happy, I think?
(2) No, I'm miserable

>Happy, I think?

You: "I'd say happy. We have an okay life."

Sidekick: "Yeah!"

You: "I do have a thing I'm already trying to achieve. That shows I'm not a passive character. It's going all right at the moment, but it could be going even better."

Sidekick: "Oh good point! Remind me what values motivate your activity?"

(1) I have an artist driven by my muse
(2) I am in love and I want to get together with my beloved

>I am in love and I want to get together with my beloved

You: "I'm madly in love..."

Sidekick: "Oh THIS activity. Right. I've already heard all about that. You can't really stop talking about it."

Sidekick: "To be clear, I also am totally trying to achieve a thing."

(1) Take an interest in Sidekick's thing
(2) Keep talking about my thing

>Keep talking about my thing

You: "Concerning my own problem, here's what I'm working on..."

Sidekick: "I am very sympathetic. I may also have some practical advice to offer you."

You: "Thank you so much."

Sidekick: "We are having a fantastic time together, enjoying our friendship. I really mean a lot to you. Remember that when something bad happens to me later."

You: "I will definitely do that. Would you like to give me some kind of small physical token of our connection? I feel like I might want it later for symbolic purposes."

Sidekick gives the symbolic token to you.

Sidekick: "Good thinking there. Don't lose it, okay?"
