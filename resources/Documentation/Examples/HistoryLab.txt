Index: Identifying nouns by the last thing done to them
Description: We create phrases such as "the box we took" and "the newspaper Clark looked at" based on what has already happened in the story.
For: Z-Machine

The examples [Variety] and [Narrative Register] show how verbs can be associated with particular actions. Here, we use the same principle so that we can report to the player what was last done to a particular object, either by the player or by someone else.

To do this, we need to use the idea of [stored actions] from the [Advanced Actions] chapter.

	{*}"History Lab"
	
	Section 1 - Procedure
	
	An object has an action called the last action.
	
	Describing relates various verbs to various action names. The verb to describe means the describing relation.
	
	To take is a verb. The verb take describes the taking action.
	To drop is a verb. The verb drop describes the dropping action.
	To look at is a verb. The verb look at describes the examining action.
	To examine is a verb. The verb examine describes the examining action.
	
	After an actor doing something to something:
		if a verb describes the action name part of the current action:
			now the indefinite article of the noun is "the";
			now the last action of the noun is the current action;
		continue the action.
	
	After printing the name of something (called item):
		if the last action of the item is not waiting and the last action of the item is not the current action:
			let chosen action-name be the action name part of the last action of the item;
			let chosen actor be the actor part of the the last action of the item;
			if a verb describes the chosen action-name:
				let the chosen verb be a random verb that describes the chosen action-name;
				say " [if the chosen actor is the player][we][else][chosen actor][end if] [adapt chosen verb in past tense]";
	
	Section 2 - Scenario
	
	Lab is a room. It contains a box. The box contains a newspaper. Clark is a man in the Lab.
	
	A persuasion rule:
		persuasion succeeds.
	
	Test me with "x box / look / x newspaper / look / clark, x newspaper / clark, get box / clark, drop box / look / take box / i / smell box / i".

Notice that smelling the box does not change the box's description because we haven't gotten around to defining a smell or sniff verb.
