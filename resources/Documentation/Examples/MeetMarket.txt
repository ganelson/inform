^^{Relations applying to multiple values of the same kind}

We have already seen that we can give things value properties – a lamp has a brightness, for instance. Relations give us additional flexibility: since we may relate various things to various values, it is possible to describe a thing as having more than one value at the same time.

To demonstrate:

	{*}"Meet Market" by "K M and Eric Rossing"
	
	Feature is a kind of value.  The features are snub-nosed, gangly, comely, bright-eyed, and sulky.
	
	Appearance relates various persons to various features.  The verb to appear means the appearance relation.
	
	Meet Market is a room.
	
	Bob, Carol, Ted, and Alice are people in the Meet Market.
	
	Bob appears snub-nosed and gangly.
	
	Ted appears sulky and snub-nosed.
	
	Carol appears comely and bright-eyed.
	
	Alice appears bright-eyed and comely.
	
	Yourself appears sulky and gangly.
	
	Instead of looking:
		say "The snub-nosed ones: [list of people who appear snub-nosed][line break]";
		say "The gangly ones: [list of people who appear gangly][line break]";
		say "The comely ones: [list of people who appear comely][line break]";
		say "The bright-eyed ones: [list of people who appear bright-eyed][line break]";
		say "The sulky ones: [list of people who appear sulky][paragraph break]".
	
	Test me with "look".

The same logic might be used to provide characters who have complex mood states: a person might be angry and sad, not merely one or the other – feelings being what they are.
