  Penny grimaces at you-- Penny is the same woman who stepped on your toe in the buffet line. The third time, she blurted, "You have big shoes, don't you?"
  
  Frince and Tim are chattering.

  Loud. Brash. Hot, probably, if you can look past the loud and brash.
  
  The bright coral lipstick was really not a wise choice.

  Frince is a friend of yours -- if you reckon friendship on the same terms that one reckons a cat as a pet. He spends time with you when he wants to, but if your wishes or convenience ever run counter to a whim of his, it's the whim that wins. Always.
  
  He's also wearing a somewhat ludicrous shirt.
  
  >[3] x shirt
  Fine white fabric with satiny white pinstripes: it's that expensive, effeminate look that Frince is so fond of, and which -- combined with his name -- gives people completely the wrong idea about him.
  
  There are a couple of smudges of coral-colored lipstick on the collar.

  You avoid Frince's eye. You need some time to adjust to the image of him making out with Penny in a storage closet before you can talk to him without appalled giggling.
  
  Tim and Penny are following the spin of the roulette breathlessly.
