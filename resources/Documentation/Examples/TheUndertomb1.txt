This example creates a kind of room, `dead end`, and gives each a textual description called its `river sound`. Note the use of a text substitution to fill in the appropriate `river sound` text in each `dead end`.

	{*}"The Undertomb"
	
	A dead end is a kind of room with printed name "Dead End" and description "This is a dead end. You'll have to go back the way you came, consoled only by [river sound]." A dead end is usually dark.
	
	The Undertomb is a dark room. East is a dead end. South is a dead end with printed name "Collapsed Dead End". Northwest is a dead end called the Tortuous Alcove. In the Undertomb is the lantern. It is lit.
	
	A dead end has some text called river sound. The river sound of a dead end is usually "a faint whispering of running water". The Tortuous Alcove has river sound "a gurgle of running water".
	
	Test me with "get lantern / e / w / s / n / nw / se".
