Description: Filtering the names of rooms printed while in darkness.
For: Z-Machine

In this example, we want the names of rooms to be asterisked out if the player wanders around without the benefit of a candle. We can do this by treating the room names as text, then replacing every letter:

	{*}"Blackout"
	
	Tiny Room is a dark room. Absurdly Long-Named Room is a dark room. It is west of Tiny Room.
	
	The Candle Factory is north of Tiny Room. It contains a beeswax candle. The beeswax candle is lit.
	
	Rule for printing the name of a dark room:
		let N be "[location]";
		replace the regular expression "\w" in N with "*";
		say "[N]".
	
	Test me with "w / look / e / n / get candle / s / w".

Notice that the hyphen in the Absurdly Long-Named Room does not get replaced. We could replace even that, if we liked, with

		replace the regular expression "\S" in N with "*";

which would catch every character that is not a space.
