Description: Making writing that can be separately examined from the paper on which it appears, but which directs all other actions to the paper.
For: Z-Machine

Sometimes it is useful to direct all – or almost all – actions from one object to another. For the sake of argument, say we have a sheet of paper with writing on it, and (because we're very meticulous) we want to let the player examine the writing and get a customised response, different from when they just examine the sheet of paper. But for all other purposes – say, ``TAKE`` or ``TASTE`` – we want the two objects to be treated as one.

Here, we approach the problem by changing the noun and/or the second noun of the current action, then issuing a new command to `try the current action`. Because we've changed the noun and second noun, the `current action` at this point is different from the one generated originally by the player's command.

	{*}"Fine Laid"
	
	High Street Stationer is a room.
	
	The sheet of paper is a thing in High Street Stationer. The writing is part of the sheet of paper.
	
	The description of the sheet of paper is "A beautiful sheet of heavy cream paper." The description of the writing is "Delicate and spidery."
	
	Instead of tasting the sheet of paper, say "You might need more fiber in your diet, but this isn't the way.".
	
	Before doing something other than examining when the current action involves the writing:
		if the writing is the noun, now the noun is the sheet of paper;
		if the writing is the second noun, now the second noun is the sheet of paper;
		try the current action instead.
	
	Test me with "examine sheet of paper / examine writing / get writing / taste writing".
