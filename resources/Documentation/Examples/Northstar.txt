Index: ASK person TO do something, understood
Description: Making Inform understand ``ASK JOSH TO TAKE INVENTORY`` as ``JOSH, TAKE INVENTORY``. This requires us to use a regular expression on the player's command, replacing some of the content.
For: Z-Machine

Most of the time, Inform understands commands to other characters when they take the form ``JOSH, TAKE INVENTORY`` or ``JOAN, WEAR THE ARMOR``. But novice players might also try commands of the form ``ASK JOSH TO TAKE INVENTORY`` or ``ORDER JOAN TO WEAR THE ARMOR``.

The easiest way to make Inform understand such commands is to meddle directly with the player's command, changing it into the format that the game will understand, as here:

	{*}"Northstar"
	
	The Northstar Cafe is a room. "The Northstar is crammed with its usual brunch crowd, and you were lucky to get a table at all. You are now awaiting the arrival of your ricotta pancakes."
	
	Josh is a man in The Northstar Cafe. "Josh is on his way past your table." The description of Josh is "He is a waiter here, but you also know him socially, so he tends to be more chatty than the other waiters." A persuasion rule: persuasion succeeds.
	
	After reading a command:
		let N be "[the player's command]";
		replace the regular expression "\b(ask|tell|order) (.+?) to (.+)" in N with "\2, \3";
		change the text of the player's command to N.
	
	Test me with "ask Josh to take inventory / tell Josh to take inventory / order Josh to take inventory".

Note that we have to copy N back explicitly to replace the player's command.
