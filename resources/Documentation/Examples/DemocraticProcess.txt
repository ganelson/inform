^^{PUT and INSERT automatically TAKE first}

`stop the action` is most useful when we need to write rules that will have to stop the action some of the time but at other times let it pass. For example, let's create a polling station, where the idea is to ``TAKE BALLOT``, ``VOTE``, and then ``PUT BALLOT IN MACHINE``:

	{*}"Democratic Process"
	
	The Assembly Room is a room. "On most days, this room is used for elementary school assemblies; at the moment, it serves as a voting place." The ballot is on the desk. The desk is in the Assembly Room.

	The ballot can be marked or unmarked. The description of the ballot is "The old-fashioned sort you mark by hand.[if the ballot is marked] A cross in a deranged hand is written next to 'Hiram Q. Flathead IV'."

	The machine is a container in the Assembly Room. "On the ballot machine is a sign which reads 'PUT BALLOTS IN ME :)'." Understand "ballot machine" as the machine.

	Voting is an action applying to nothing. Understand "vote" as voting.

	Check voting:
		if the ballot is marked, say "Not for another four years, thank you."

	Carry out voting:
		now the ballot is marked.

	Report voting:
		say "You perform your solemn duty, nobly inking in a cross."

We need some rules to prevent blank ballots being put into the machine. A neat way to do that is to automate the process, so that ``PUT BALLOT IN MACHINE`` automatically triggers ``VOTE``, and ``VOTE`` in turn automatically takes the ballot if the player hasn't got it:

	{**}Before inserting the unmarked ballot into something:
		say "(first writing in your vote)[line break]";
		try voting;
		if the ballot is unmarked, stop the action.

	Before voting when the player is not carrying the ballot:
		say "(first taking [the ballot])[line break]";
		silently try taking the ballot;
		if the player is not carrying the ballot, stop the action.

	Test me with "put ballot in machine".
