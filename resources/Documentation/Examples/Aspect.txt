^^{Understanding units as part of the name of a thing}

Named properties are not the only kind that Inform is able to understand referring to an object. We can also use unit and number properties to distinguish things from one another, as here, where televisions have aspect ratios:

	{*}"Aspect"
	
	An aspect ratio is a kind of value. 16:9 specifies an aspect ratio.
	
	A television is a kind of device. A television has an aspect ratio. Understand the aspect ratio property as referring to a television. Understand "European standard" as 16:9.
	
	The Office is a room.
	
	The widescreen TV is a television in the Office. The fifties TV is a television in the Office. The widescreen TV is 16:9. The fifties TV is 4:3.
	
	Test me with "examine european standard tv / x 16:9 tv / x 4:3 tv".
