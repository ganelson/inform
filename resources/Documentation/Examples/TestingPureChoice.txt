Description: Modifying the offering activity so that it follows a test script rather than stopping to ask for player input.

Most Inform examples contain a `Test me with "..."` sentence, giving a sequence of commands which can be automatically typed in for testing purposes.

And that works fine for dialogue-heavy stories too, _provided_ there is a first turn on which the player can type ``TEST ME``. In a story where dialogue takes over the entire narrative, and no regular commands are ever accepted, that's impossible.

So the following use of the `offering ...` activity neatly gets around that. It's just like the standard version of the activity, except that if there are numbers in the `testing choices list`, it pulls them out one by one and enters them rather than ask the player.

	{*}"Testing Pure Choice"
	
	Section 1 - The testing mechanism

	The testing choices list is a list of numbers that varies.

	For offering a list of dialogue choices (called L)
		(this is the niftier offering dialogue choices rule):
		let N be 0;
		repeat with C running through L:
			increase N by 1;
			say "([N]) [textual content of C][line break]";
		say conditional paragraph break;
		let M be a number;
		if the testing choices list is non-empty:
			now M is entry 1 of the testing choices list;
			remove entry 1 from the testing choices list;
			say "(automatically choosing option [M] for test purposes)[line break]";
		otherwise:
			now M is a number chosen by the player from 1 to N;
		set the dialogue selection value to M;
		say "[bold type][textual content of entry M of L][roman type][paragraph break]".

So we just need to set the list up. We want to make a test-run of "Pure Choice" in which the player selects 1, then 2, then 1, so:

	{**}When play begins:
		say "Howdy!";
		now the testing choices list is { 1, 2, 1 }.

Everything else here is the same as for the "Pure Choice" example:
	
	{**}Section 2 - The set, actors and props
	 
	The Stage Set is a room.
	
	Instead of looking: do nothing instead. 
	
	Section 3 - The play (dialogue)
	
	(This is the starting beat.)
	
	Narration: "Here we might place our opening narration.
	
	We could go on for several paragraphs, if we like. There's no need to make them separate lines of narration if we do not want to."
	
		-- "I get the general idea."
		
			Narration: "Good." 
	
		-- "Cool. Now show me something else."
		
			Narration: "This text is only shown because of the choice you just made. But in a moment, we'll rejoin the same storyline as though you'd made the opposite decision. Right about... NOW." 

	Narration: "Speaking of choices, the following two won't make any difference at all. The player's decision will immediately rejoin, leaving them only with the recollection of having made a choice in the first place."
	
		-- "I will remember this."
		
		-- "I will forget this almost immediately."
	
	Narration: "Here, by contrast..."
	
		-- "This branch is actually significant."
		
			-> perform the lefthand beat
		
		-- "As is this one."
		
			-> perform the righthand beat
			
	(This is the lefthand beat.)
	
	Narration: "You have passed through the left door."
	
	-> end the story finally
	
	(This is the righthand beat.)
	
	Narration: "You have passed through the right door. The narrative has branched, and it will not rejoin; your decision was permanent."
	
	-> end the story finally
