Description: Creating a beta-testing command that matches any line starting with punctuation.
For: Z-Machine

^^{Testing command}

Sometimes we want to let testers of a game insert their own comments during a transcript, without those comments wasting turns of the game or producing lengthy or inappropriate parser errors. Many testers have a habit of prefacing comments with a punctuation mark, so let's say that we'd like to catch any command that starts with any punctuation at all:

	{*}"Alpha"
	
	When play begins:
		say "Hi, Larry! Thanks for testing my game!!"
	
	Unimplemented Room is a room. "Room description goes here..."
	
	The scary troll is a man in Unimplemented Room.
	
	After reading a command (this is the ignore beta-comments rule):
		if the player's command matches the regular expression "^\p":
			say "(Noted.)";
			reject the player's command.
	
	Test me with "x me / x troll / !this game is a bit dull so far / kiss troll / ? does this troll do anything? / :yawn".
