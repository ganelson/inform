^^{dropping+action+: even objects the player carries indirectly}

By default, Inform only lets the player drop those things which they are carrying â€“ that is, those directly in their possession. Things inside satchels or on portable trays have to be taken first.

If we want to change this behaviour, we might add a dropping rule that distinguishes between carrying and mere enclosure (introduced back in "The location of something" in the chapter on [Things]):

	{*}"Celadon"
	
	The Tea Room is a room. The player carries a black lacquer tray. The lacquer tray is portable. On the lacquer tray are a celadon teapot and a napkin.
	
	Before dropping something:
		if the player does not carry the noun and the player encloses the noun:
			say "(first taking [the noun] from [the holder of the noun])[command clarification break]";
			silently try taking the noun;
			if the player does not carry the noun, stop the action.
	
	Instead of taking the napkin:
		say "It seems to be stuck to the tray, possibly by an underlying wad of gum."
	
	Test me with "i / drop teapot / i / look / drop teapot / drop napkin / i / drop tray".
