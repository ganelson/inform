When two people are in the same room, there's a 1/3 chance that an infected person will infect a non-infected one. The player can cure any single person: victory condition - to stamp out the disease."
	
	When play begins:

	Hamwi Street is northeast of an iron gate. "A U-shaped street running from Main Street around to the Memorial Square, Hamwi Street was recently added by ambitious city planners. The small and straggly line of trees has yet to grow enough to provide perceptible shade, so the street is even hotter and more unforgiving than the other parts of town."
	
	The iron gate is northeast of Nancy Johnson Memorial Square. The iron gate is a door. It is lockable and unlocked.
	
	Before printing the name of the iron gate while not opening or closing or locking or unlocking:

	Marciony Street is southeast of Nancy Johnson Memorial Square. "A semi-circular terrace, named somewhat fancifully after one claimant to the invention of the ice cream cone -- though Hamwi Street competes for the same honor. There are wedges of cool shadow here and there thanks to the buildings, but for the most part the southern exposure keeps Marciony unpleasantly hot."

An incongruous sign hangs from the ceiling." The incongruous sign is scenery in the Public Library. The description of the incongruous sign is "Eating and drinking in the library is STRICTLY PROHIBITED."
	
	Town Hall is southeast of Main Street. "Town Hall was built during the slow days of the ice-cream bust, and therefore it is as joyless and utilitarian as the Public Library is ridiculous. Unwilling to be reminded of their pain, the inhabitants steered clear of any decoration that might remotely be construed to resemble a scoop of anything: so there are no curves, only disciplined right angles." The key to the city is in Town Hall. It unlocks the iron gate. It unlocks the bronze gates.  The description of the key to the city is "A skeleton key."

	The conversation of a person is usually Table of General ChitChat.

	"sun/sunlight"	"'Good thing the town mostly switched to solar power, har, har.'"	"that the town is mostly relying on solar power"
	"rain"	"'Nope, there isn't going to be rain for 132 days,' replies [the noun]."	"that rain is not expected for another 132 days"
	"snow/hail/ice"	"This hilarious sally is greeted with hoots of laughter only."	"that the concept of snow is downright laughable"

	"forecast/weatherman" or "weather forecast/man"	"'Oh, the weather man's gotten a lot more reliable since the gummint started making it for us,' says [the noun].

	The conversation of Vanessa is the Table of Vanessa Chatter.
	
	Table of Vanessa Chatter
	topic	reply	summary	turn stamp	character
	"ice cream" or "sorbet/sherbet/flavor/flavors/flavour/flavours/ice/ices"	"'The flavors are [list of flavors],' she responds promptly, without needing to draw breath."	"that the flavors are [list of flavors]"	a number	a person
	
	After reading a command:
		while player's command includes "the":
			cut the matched text.

This strips 'the' out of the command, so that ``ASK PERSON ABOUT THE RAIN`` will be understood as well as ``ASK PERSON ABOUT RAIN``.

Now we try something a bit unusual. Inform on its own will report each action on its own line, so that each character who walks into or out of a room will be described in a separate paragraph. This is usually fine, but in a game with a lot of characters moving around simultaneously, it can become a bit overwhelming. Instead, we may want to condense these reports into a single line, such as "Ben and Jerry enter from the south". The following accomplishes that goal by replacing some of the reporting rules, storing the information in a table, and then reading the table back later, once all the character movement has been resolved and the reports can usefully be collated:

	A person has some text called walk style. The walk style of a man is usually "stride". The walk style of a woman is usually "strut". The walk style of Gene is "[one of]wander[or]stroll[purely at random]". The walk style of Francine is "waddle". The walk style of Antony is "scamper". The walk style of Rhoda is "sashay".
	
	Table of Visible Exits
	character	second	third	heading chosen	total
	a person	a person	a person	a direction	a number
	with 10 blank rows.
	
	Table of Visible Entrances
	character	second	third	heading chosen	total
	a person	a person	a person	a direction	a number
	with 10 blank rows.
	
	To clear (current table - a table name):
		repeat through current table:
			blank out the whole row.
	
	To tidy departures of (current table - a table name):
		let next direction be up;
		repeat through current table:
			if heading chosen entry is next direction:
				let accomplice be character entry;
				choose row with heading chosen of next direction in the current table;
				if total entry is 1:
					now second entry is accomplice;
					now total entry is 2;
				if total entry is 2:
					unless the second entry is accomplice:
						now third entry is accomplice;
						now total entry is 3;
				choose row with character of accomplice in the current table;
				blank out the whole row;
			otherwise:
				let next direction be heading chosen entry.
	
	A door has a person called last opener.
	
	Report someone opening a door:
		now group size is 1;
		now the last opener of the noun is the person asked;
		if the person asked is visible, say "[The person asked] opens [the noun]. [run paragraph on]" instead;
		otherwise say "[The noun] opens from the other side. [run paragraph on]" instead.
	
	Report someone going through a door (called route):
		if the person asked is not the last opener of the route, continue the action;
		if the person asked is the last person named, say "[The person asked as pronoun]";
		otherwise say "[The person asked]";
		say " [if the person asked is in the location]comes[otherwise]goes[end if] through[if the last thing named is not the route] [the route][end if]." instead.
	
	The last thing named is a thing that varies. Before printing the name of something (called target) which is not a person: now the last thing named is the target.
	
	Report someone going a direction:
		if the person asked is in the location,
			choose a blank row in the table of visible entrances;
		otherwise choose a blank row in the table of visible exits;
		now character entry is the person asked;
		now total entry is 1;
		if the person asked is in the location,
			now heading chosen entry is the opposite of the noun;
		otherwise now heading chosen entry is the noun;
		stop the action.
	
	This is the movement reporting rule:
		sort the Table of Visible Entrances in heading chosen order;
		tidy departures of the table of visible entrances;
		sort the Table of Visible exits in heading chosen order;
		tidy departures of the table of visible exits;
		let total row count be the number of filled rows in the Table of Visible Entrances plus the number of filled rows in the Table of Visible Exits;
		if total row count is 0, rule succeeds;
		generate descriptions from the Table of Visible Entrances;
		generate descriptions from the Table of Visible Exits;
		clear the Table of Visible Entrances; clear the Table of Visible Exits.
	
	To generate descriptions from (current table - a table name):
		let count be the number of filled rows in the current table;
		if count is 0, rule succeeds;
		let index be count;
		repeat through the current table:
			let accomplice be character entry;
			if character entry is a person, now character entry is marked for listing;
			if there is a second entry and second entry is a person, now second entry is marked for listing;
			if there is a third entry and third entry is a person, now third entry is marked for listing;
			let target be the room the heading chosen entry from the location;
			if total entry is 3, say "[The character entry], [the second entry][optional comma] and [the third entry] ";
			if total entry is 2, say "[The character entry] and [the second entry] ";
			if total entry is 1:
				if the character entry is the last person named, say "[The character entry as pronoun] ";
				otherwise say "[The character entry] ";
			if total entry is 1, say "[walk style of the character entry]s ";
			otherwise say "walk[if total entry is 1]s[end if] ";
			if the character entry is in the location:
				if location is indoors and target is indoors, say "over from ";
				if location is outdoors and target is indoors, say "out of ";
				if location is indoors and target is outdoors, say "in from ";
				if location is outdoors and target is outdoors, say "over from ";
			otherwise:
				if location is indoors and target is indoors, say "over to ";
				if location is outdoors and target is indoors, say "into ";
				if location is indoors and target is outdoors, say "out [if a door is visible][the random visible door][end if] to ";
				if location is outdoors and target is outdoors, say "over to ";
			if target is outdoors, say "[the heading chosen entry]";
			otherwise say "[the target]";
			if the total entry is 1 and count is 1 and accomplice carries something, say ", carrying [a list of things carried by the accomplice]";
			decrement index;
			make delimiter index of count, continuing;
			now group size is total entry;
		if a marked for listing person is infected:
			[eliminate the case in which we have already seen this description because we just typed LOOK and the patient was in the room at the time]
			if looking and a marked for listing person is not in the location:
				clear marked people;
				say paragraph break;
			otherwise:
				describe patients;
		otherwise:
			clear marked people;
			say paragraph break.
	
	The last person named is a person that varies. Before printing the name of a person (called target): now the last person named is the target. Group size is a number that varies. Group size is 1.
	
	To clear marked people:
		repeat with named party running through people:
			now the named party is not marked for listing.
	
	Before listing nondescript items:
		if the number of people who are marked for listing is 0, make no decision;
		say "You can see [a list of people who are marked for listing] here. ";
		now group size is the number of people who are marked for listing;
		describe patients;
		now every marked for listing person is not marked for listing.
	
	To describe patients:
		if every marked for listing person is infected and at least three people are marked for listing:
			say "They are all sick as dogs, every one.";
			clear marked people;
			rule succeeds;
		otherwise:
			if the number of people who are marked for listing is greater than two and the number of infected people who are marked for listing is greater than the number of clean people who are marked for listing:
				say "Only [the list of clean people who are marked for listing] currently remain[if the number of clean people who are marked for listing is 1]s[end if] untainted.";
				clear marked people;
				rule succeeds;
		let count be the number of marked for listing other people who are infected;
		if count is 0:
			say paragraph break;
			make no decision;
		let index be count;
		repeat with patient running through marked for listing other people who are infected:
			if index is count:
				if count is 1 and the patient is the last person named:
					say "[The patient as pronoun]";
				otherwise:
					say "[The patient]";
			otherwise:
				say "[the patient]";
			say " [looks as though dipped in for index] [infection color of the patient]";
			decrement index;
			make delimiter index of count;
		clear marked people.
	
	To say (named character - a man) as pronoun:
		if group size is 1, say "He"; if group size is 2, say "The latter"; if group size is greater than 2, say "The last".
	
	To say (named character - a woman) as pronoun: if group size is 1, say "She"; if group size is 2, say "The latter"; if group size is greater than 2, say "The last".
	
	To say looks as though dipped in for (index - a number):
		let divider be the number of filled rows in the Table of Dipping Phrases;
		if index is greater than 4, let index be the remainder after dividing index by divider;
		choose row index in the Table of Dipping Phrases;
		say dipping entry.
	
	Table of Dipping Phrases
	dipping
	"looks as though dipped in"
	"could have been rolling in"
	"has a bad case of"
	"suffers from"
	"contracted a virulent"
	
	A door is usually scenery.

The next part could be simpler, but for rigour we will write it in such a way that it will work whether or not the serial comma is in use. This requires some extra work.

	{**}To make delimiter (index - a number) of (count - a number), continuing or halting:
		if index is 0:
			if continuing, say ". [run paragraph on]";
			otherwise say ".";
		otherwise if index is 1:
			if count is 2, say " and ";
			otherwise say "[optional comma] and ";
		otherwise:
			say ", ".
	
	To say optional comma:
		if the serial comma option is active:
			say ",".
	
	Test me with "go to cold comfort / z / z / z / z / ask vanessa for french vanilla / ask vanessa for chocolate / ask vanessa about flavors / ask vanessa for chocolate chocolate chip".

Because so much of this game is randomised, it will not be possible to provide a test command that systematically solves it. A good strategy is to go to Main Street, get the syringe; go to the Town Hall and get the key; then visit the shops, inject everyone, and lock them in when they've all been injected. Then go to the Pool Hall, turn on the air conditioner, and wait for the remaining parties to show up.

This is also something that could get fairly slow if we added many more rooms and characters to it. In that case, we might want to select fast route-finding so that character movement won't take as long. This will cost memory, possibly forcing the game into Glulx format if it isn't already, but significantly reduce the run-time for large maps with numerous people moving each turn:

	{*}Use fast route-finding.
