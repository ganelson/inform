Description: An object that is only visible and manipulable when a bright light fixture is on.
For: Z-Machine

Suppose we want a different treatment of lighting than the usual: the room isn't totally dark, but there's something we can't see unless we turn on a bright light.

	{*}"Low Light"

First we make our environment and its light:

	{**}The Workroom is a room. The desk is in the Workroom. The brilliant lamp is a device on the desk.
	
	To decide whether the light level is high:
		if the brilliant lamp is switched off, no;
		if the player cannot see the brilliant lamp, no;
		yes.
	
	To decide whether the light level is low:
		if the light level is high, no;
		yes.

Now we make a shadow so that the player can only refer to it if the shadow is in inventory or the light is on:

	{**}The shadow is a privately-named thing on the desk.
	
	Understand "barely-visible" or "barely visible" or "shadow" as the shadow when the light level is high. Understand "invisible" or "shadow" as the shadow when the player encloses the shadow.

And finally a couple of extra touches to make it clear why we're able to interact with the shadow when it's in inventory, even if the light is low:

	{**}Before printing the name of the shadow:
		if the light level is high:
			say "barely-visible ";
		otherwise if the player encloses the shadow:
			say "invisible (but tangible) "
	
	After dropping the shadow when the light level is low:
		say "You let it go and it fades into the ambient gloom."

To handle the appearance of the object, we want to set its locale priority to 0: that will prevent it being named in room descriptions.

	{**}After choosing notable locale objects:
		unless the light level is high:
			set locale priority of the shadow to 0.
	
	Test me with "look / get shadow / turn on lamp / look / get shadow / i / turn off lamp / i / drop shadow / look / get shadow / turn on lamp / look".
