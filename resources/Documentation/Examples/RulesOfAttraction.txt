Often we have some salient features of an object that we want to make sure the player notices whenever looking at the item in a room or in inventory. At other times, we may prefer to allow the name of the item to be printed bare. So for instance:

	{*}"Rules of Attraction"
	
	A metal form is a kind of thing. A magnet is a kind of metal form.
	
	Every turn:
		repeat with item running through nonmagnetic metal forms which are not part of something:
			if item is in a container which contains a magnet (called attractor):
				say "[The item] sticks to [the attractor].";
				now the item is part of the attractor.
	
	The horseshoe magnet is a magnet carried by the player. The nail is a metal form carried by the player. The Barn is a room. In the Barn is a bucket. In the bucket is a metal form called the iron hook.
	
	Definition: a thing is nonmagnetic if it is not a magnet.
	
	Rule for printing room description details of a magnet (called attractor): if something is part of the attractor, say " (stuck to which [is-are the list of things which are part of the attractor])".
	
	After printing the name of a magnet (called attractor) while taking inventory:
		if something is part of the attractor, say " (stuck to which [is-are the list of things which are part of the attractor])".
	
	Before taking a touchable thing which is part of a magnet (called attractor):
		move the noun to the holder of the attractor.
	
	Test me with "i / put horseshoe in bucket / look / get horseshoe / i / drop horseshoe / i / look / get all / put all in bucket / i / x magnet / get nail / i".
