	{*}"Boston Cream"
	
	Use scoring.
	
	The Donut Shop is a room. "Vibrantly decorated in donut colors: pink, brown, and cream."
	
	Ogg is a man in the Donut Shop. "Ogg is slumped in the corner[if Ogg carries something] with [a list of things carried by Ogg][end if]. He wears a nametag which says 'HELLO MY NAME IS OG.'" Understand "og" as Ogg. Ogg wears a nametag. The description of the nametag is "Very neatly written."
	
	The Donut Shop contains a transparent closed openable locked lockable enterable container called a case. The case is fixed in place. The case contains some cake donuts, some jelly donuts, and some apple fritters. "The [if unopenable]damaged[otherwise]gleaming[end if] donut case [if something is in the case]contains [a list of things in the case][otherwise]has been stripped of its contents[end if]." The cake donuts, the jelly donuts, and the apple fritters are edible.
	
	The matching key of the case is a silver key. The silver key is in a mesh basket. The mesh basket is closed, transparent, and openable. It is in the Donut Shop.
	
	Before someone taking something which is carried by the player:
		if the person asked cannot touch the player:
			say "Ogg looks with a fixed frown at [the noun].";
			continue the action;
		say "[The person asked] comes up and shakes your arm until you drop [the noun].";
		say line break;
		silently try dropping the noun;
		stop the action.
	
	Before someone unlocking a locked thing with something which is not carried by the person asked:
		try the person asked taking the second noun;
		stop the action.
	
	Before someone opening a locked thing (called the sealed chest):
		if the person asked can see the matching key of the sealed chest:
			if the matching key of the sealed chest is enclosed by the sealed chest:
				say "Seeing the paradoxical location of [the matching key of the sealed chest], [the person asked] gives a howl of rage.";
				increment the score;
				end the story finally saying "You have thwarted Ogg";
			otherwise:
				try the person asked unlocking the sealed chest with the matching key of the sealed chest;
			stop the action.
	
	Before someone taking something which is in a closed container (called the shut chest):
		try the person asked opening the shut chest;
		stop the action.
	
	Ogg has a number called hunger. The hunger of Ogg is 0.
	
	Every turn:
		increment the hunger of Ogg;
		if the hunger of Ogg is 2 and Ogg is visible, say "Ogg's stomach growls.";
		if the hunger of Ogg is 3 and Ogg is visible:
			if Ogg can see an edible thing (called the target):
				say "Ogg eyes [the target] with obvious intent.";
			otherwise:
				say "Ogg glances at you in a disturbingly shifty way.";
		if the hunger of Ogg is greater than 3:
			if Ogg carries an edible thing (called the target):
				try Ogg eating the target;
			otherwise:
				let new target be a random edible thing which can be seen by Ogg;
				if the new target is a thing:
					try Ogg taking the new target;
				otherwise:
					if Ogg can touch the player, end the story saying "Ogg is gnawing your ankle";
					otherwise try Ogg taking the player.
	
	The crumbs are a thing. "Crumbs of [the list of edible things which cannot be seen by the player] lie scattered over the whole floor."
	
	Instead of asking Ogg to try doing something when Ogg cannot touch the player:
		say "Ogg tilts his head and shrugs, unable to hear your instruction clearly."
	
	Instead of asking Ogg to try eating something:
		say "It's not as though Ogg really needs any encouragement in that department, is it?"
	
	Definition: Ogg is hungry if the hunger of Ogg is greater than 2.
	
	Persuasion rule for asking Ogg to try doing something: if Ogg is hungry, persuasion fails; persuasion succeeds.
	
	Persuasion rule for asking Ogg to try giving something edible to the player:
		persuasion fails.
	
	Unsuccessful attempt by Ogg doing something:
		if the reason the action failed is a failing listed in the Table of Ogg Retorts:
			say "[reply entry][paragraph break]";
		otherwise:
			say "Ogg looks adorably confused."
	
	Table of Ogg Retorts
	failing	reply

	can't take other people rule	"'Ogg not that greedy.'"
	can't take scenery rule	"'[The noun] very very heavy.'"
	can't take what's fixed in place rule	"'[The noun] very heavy."

	Carry out Ogg eating an edible thing:
		move the crumbs to the holder of Ogg;
		now the hunger of Ogg is 0.
	
	Report Ogg unlocking something with something:
		say "Ogg struggles a bit with [the second noun] in the lock of [the noun], but does eventually succeed. 'Hunh!' says Ogg.";
		stop the action.
	
	Carry out Ogg opening the case when the case has been open:
		now the case is unopenable.
	
	Instead of closing the unopenable case:
		say "The glass panels are no longer properly seated in their tracks, and the case cannot be closed ever again."
	
	Report Ogg opening the unopenable case:
		say "Ogg forces [the case] so hard that it does break.";
		stop the action.
	
	Report Ogg opening the case:
		say "Ogg yanks [the noun] open with such force that you fear for its structural integrity.";
		stop the action.
	
	Report Ogg taking something edible:
		say "Ogg acquires [the noun] with a look of tender affection.";
		stop the action.
	
	Report Ogg eating something:
		say "Ogg chows down on [the noun], scattering crumbs in all directions.";
		stop the action.
	
	Report Ogg eating something when the number of visible edible things is 1:
		say "Ogg eats [the noun] in his trademark style. You can no longer bear to watch.";
		stop the action.
	
	After entering the case:
		say "You climb inside the case, folding yourself up uncomfortably."
	
	After locking the case with something when the player is in the case:
		say "You turn the key firmly in the lock -- amazing it locks from within, but it does -- and settle yourself for a long wait, hoping this thing is not air-tight."
	
	The maximum score is 1.
	
	Test me with "open mesh / get key / unlock case / open case / enter case / close case / lock case / wait / wait".
