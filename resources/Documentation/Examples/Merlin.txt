^^{REMEMBER command keyed to topics}

	{*}"Merlin"
	
	Understand "remember [text]" as remembering.
	
	Remembering is an action applying to one topic.
	
	Carry out remembering:
		say "Nothing comes to mind.".
	
	Instead of remembering a topic listed in the Table of Recollections:
		say "[response entry][paragraph break]".
	
	Table of Recollections
	Topic	Response
	"rain/weather"	"You've seen worse, but not often: it's falling so hard now that the tin rattles and the runoff, on the low side of the roof, would be a tenable source of hydroelectric power."
	"hydroelectric power" or "power/hydroelectric"	"It's not as though you have any sort of light bulb in here to turn on, even if you could power it."
	"light bulb" or "light/bulb"	"Light bulbs, like so much else, are a thing of your past. Or is it your future? Tricky, the way the world loops round on itself."
	"past/time/future"	"Living backwards has its drawbacks. A tendency to confuse and annoy your friends, being one; the total inability to maintain a stable relationship; and a deep dissatisfaction with most of the bodily processes people enjoy, since they ultimately make you hungrier, colder, or-- no point dwelling on it, really."
	"backwards"	"It's not even exactly *backwards*, now is it? It's more like a series of forwardses stuck back to back. As though someone had taken each track of a CD and put them in the exactly wrong order. You miss that. The music on demand."
	
	The Inadequate Shelter is a room. "A piece of corrugated tin, leaned on two sticks, and pathetically augmented with a tire (on one side) and a cardboard box (on the side towards the wind). And that's what you've got between you and the driving rain.
	
	At the moment rain is all you can remember, in fact."
	
	Test me with "remember rain / remember power / remember light bulb / remember future / remember backwards".
