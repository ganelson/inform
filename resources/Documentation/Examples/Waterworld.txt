Example: * Waterworld
Location: Changing reachability
RecipeLocation: Continuous Spaces and The Outdoors
Index: Backdrops which can only be examined
Description: A backdrop which the player can examine, but cannot interact with in any other way.
For: Z-Machine

It's tempting to handle the player's inability to interact with something with a simple instead rule:

	{*}"Waterworld 1"
	
	A view is a kind of backdrop. Instead of doing something other than examining to a view, say "You are too far from [the noun] to do anything but look."
	
	The sun is a view. It is everywhere. The description is "A blazing sun makes you wish you had never been born."
	
	The Sahara is a room. North of the Sahara is More Sahara. North of More Sahara is Yet Further Sahara.
	
	Test me with "x sun / get sun / n / x sun / n / x sun".

Unfortunately, the rule does not address the case where the object in question is the second noun; so for instance the following example reveals the difficulty:

	{*}"Waterworld 2"
	
	A view is a kind of backdrop. Instead of doing something other than examining to a view, say "You are too far from [the noun] to do anything but look."
	
	The player carries a rope.
	
	The sun is a view. It is everywhere. The description is "A blazing sun makes you wish you had never been born."
	
	The Sahara is a room. North of the Sahara is More Sahara. North of More Sahara is Yet Further Sahara.
	
	Test me with "x sun / get sun / n / x sun / n / x sun / tie rope to the sun".

...where the response here behaves as though the sun is in reach. If we had a fully implemented tying action, the player would (even more disastrously) be allowed to lasso celestial objects.

We could add a second instead rule as well:

	{*}"Waterworld 3"
	
	A view is a kind of backdrop.
	
	Instead of doing something other than examining when the noun is a view:
		say "You are too far from [the noun] to do anything but look."
	Instead of doing something other than examining when the second noun is a view:
		say "You are too far from [the second noun] to do anything but look."
	
	The player carries a rope.
	
	The sun is a view. It is everywhere. The description is "A blazing sun makes you wish you had never been born."
	
	The Sahara is a room. North of the Sahara is More Sahara. North of More Sahara is Yet Further Sahara.
	
	Test me with "x sun / get sun / n / x sun / n / x sun / tie rope to sun".
