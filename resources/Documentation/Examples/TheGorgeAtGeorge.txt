	{*}"Gorge at George"
	
	The Dusty Lot is a room. "A few miles up the road from the concert venue, but at least it's cheap to park here."
	
	The motorcyclist is a man in the Dusty Lot. "A man clad in [a list of things worn by the motorcyclist] leans against his Harley and watches you without saying anything." The Harley is scenery in the Lot. The motorcyclist wears a black leather jacket and shades. Understand "man" or "guy" as the motorcyclist.
	
	Understand "talk to [someone]" as a mistake ("To start a conversation, try to ASK [the noun] ABOUT something or TELL [the noun] ABOUT something.").
	
	Instead of asking the motorcyclist about something:
		say "He smirks cryptically."
	
	Instead of telling the motorcyclist about something:
		say "This does not seem to interest him much."
	
	Test me with "talk to motorcyclist / ask motorcyclist about himself / tell motorcyclist about me".
