^^{Pig Latin for the player's commands}

For the sake of argument, suppose we want to parrot back all the player's commands in pig Latin:

	{*}"Igpay Atinlay"
	
	Armfay is a room.
	
	After reading a command:
		let N be "[the player's command]";
		replace the regular expression "\b(<aeiou>+)(\w*)" in N with "\1\2ay";
		replace the regular expression "\b(<bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxz>+)(\w*)" in N with "\2\1ay";
		say "[N][paragraph break]";
		reject the player's command.
	
	Test me with "nix on the stupid".
