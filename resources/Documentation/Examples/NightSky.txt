Description: A room which changes its description depending on whether an object has been examined.
For: Z-Machine

Sometimes a nice effect is to change the way things are described depending on the information the player has gained in the course of play. We could for instance write this:

	{*}"Night Sky"
	
	The Planetarium is a room. "[if we have examined the sinister message]A dark room where it seems something is about to jump out at you![otherwise]A tranquil dark room with a ceilingful of stars.[end if]"
	
	The sinister message is a thing in the Planetarium. "A message is taped to the wall." The description is "'BEWARE.'"
	
	Test me with "look / x message / look".

On the other hand, beware that this would not work as desired:

	The Planetarium is a room. "[if we have listened to the sinister message]A dark room where it seems something is about to jump out at you![otherwise]A tranquil dark room with a ceilingful of stars.[end if]"
	
	The sinister message is a thing in the Planetarium. "A message plays very softly, so that you would have to listen to hear it." Instead of doing anything other than listening to the message: say "It's only a sound, after all.". Instead of listening to the sinister message: say "A voice whispers, 'BEWARE'."
	
	Test me with "listen to message / look".

The reason is that our `Instead` rule has pre-empted normal listening, so Inform considers that we have never successfully heard the message. The moral here is that `if we have...` is useful for tracking events that otherwise proceeded completely normally (picking up ordinary objects, examining things); if we have used instead to make some change, we will have to use a different approach to record that the event did occur as scheduled.
