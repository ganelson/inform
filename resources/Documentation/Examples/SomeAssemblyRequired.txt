Description: Building different styles of shirt from component sleeves and collars.
For: Z-Machine

We now have the mechanisms in place to do some fairly sophisticated renaming of objects. For instance:

	{*}"Some Assembly Required"
	
	Garment type is a kind of value. The garment types are vest, t-shirt, polo shirt, mandarin blouse, button-down, shell, experiment.
	
	Every turn:
		assign identities.
	
	When play begins: assign identities.
	
	To assign identities:
		repeat with item running through torsos:
			reassess item.
	
	To reassess (item - a torso):
		if the number of things which are part of the item is 0:
			now garment type of the item is vest;
			rule succeeds;
		if exactly two short sleeves are part of the item:
			if a collar is part of the item,
				now garment type of the item is polo shirt;
			otherwise now garment type of the item is t-shirt;
			rule succeeds;
		if exactly two long sleeves are part of the item:
			if a collar is part of the item,
				now garment type of the item is button-down;
			otherwise now garment type of the item is mandarin blouse;
			rule succeeds;
		if a collar is part of the item and the number of sleeves which are part of the item is 0, now garment type of the item is shell;
		otherwise now garment type of the item is experiment.
	
	Before cutting something which is worn by the player:
		try taking off the noun.
	
	Instead of cutting something when something is part of the noun:
		say "You cut up [the noun], snipping off [a list of things which are part of the noun].";
		now every thing which is part of the noun is held by the holder of the noun.
	
	Instead of cutting something which is part of something:
		say "You carefully snip [the noun] free.";
		now the player carries the noun.
	
	Rule for printing the name of a torso: say "[garment type]".
	
	A torso is a kind of thing. A torso is always wearable. Understand "shirt" or "blouse" as a torso. A torso has a garment type. Understand the garment type property as describing a torso. A sleeve is a kind of thing. A short sleeve is a kind of sleeve. A long sleeve is a kind of sleeve. A collar is a kind of thing.
	
	Understand "sew [something] to [something]" as affixing it to. Affixing it to is an action applying to two things. Carry out affixing something to something: now the noun is part of the second noun. Report affixing something to something: assign identities; say "You sew [the noun] on, creating [a second noun]." Understand the command "stitch" as "sew".
	
	Instead of affixing something to something when the second noun is worn: say "You're wearing [the second noun]!"
	
	Instead of affixing a torso to something:
		if the second noun is a torso, say "Couture for Siamese twins is a daring field, but a bit of a niche market.";
		otherwise try affixing the second noun to the noun.
	
	Instead of affixing a sleeve to something when at least two sleeves are part of the second noun: say "[The second noun] already sports [a list of sleeves that are part of the second noun]."
	
	Instead of affixing a collar to something when a collar is part of the second noun: say "[The second noun] already sports [a list of collars that are part of the second noun]."
	
	Instead of examining something when something is part of the noun: say "Stitched to [the noun] [is-are a list of things which are part of the noun]."

Here is where the issue of precedence arises. We want to encourage Inform to select a cuttable object that is part of something else, rather than one of the spares:

	{**}Definition: a thing is removable if it is part of something. Understand "cut [removable thing]" as cutting.
	
	The Boutique is a room. "Still festively strewn with the confetti and streamers of the Grand Opening party, and still almost totally customer-free."
	
	The player carries a torso. The player carries three short sleeves. The player carries two long sleeves. The player carries two collars.
	
	Test me with "sew collar to shirt / i / sew short sleeve to shirt / g / i / x polo shirt / cut collar / i / cut shirt / sew long sleeve to shirt / i / sew long sleeve to shirt / i / sew collar to shirt / g / i / wear button-down".
