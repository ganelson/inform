Index: Containers which have a breaking strain
Description: To give every container a breaking strain, that is, a maximum weight of contents which it can bear - so that to put the lead pig into a paper bag invites disaster.
For: Z-Machine

The following shows the kind of "realism" rules which could be introduced using weights. Not entirely realistic: we do not bother to rupture containers out of the player's sight.

	{*}"Lead Cuts Paper"
	
	A weight is a kind of value. 10kg specifies a weight. Everything has a weight. A thing usually has weight 1kg.
	
	A container has a weight called breaking strain. The breaking strain of a container is usually 50kg. Definition: A container is bursting if the total weight of things in it is greater than its breaking strain.
	
	A lead pig, a feather, a silver coin and a paper bag are in a room called the Metallurgy Workshop. The paper bag is a container with breaking strain 2kg.  The lead pig has weight 50kg.
	
	Every turn when a container (called the sack) held by someone visible (called the chump) is bursting:
		say "[The sack] splits and breaks under the weight! [if the player is the chump]You discard[otherwise][The chump] discards[end if] its ruined remains, looking miserably down at [the list of things in the sack] on the floor.";
		now all of the things in the sack are in the location;
		now the sack is nowhere.
	
	Test me with "get bag / get feather / put feather in bag / get pig / put pig in bag / look".
