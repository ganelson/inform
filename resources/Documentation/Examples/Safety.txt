^^{Safe that can be opened with a combination}

	{*}"Safety"
	
	The Vault is a room. "Snug yet paranoid, this represents the state of the art in cheerless security." The Safe is here. "A mammoth safe, with a dial which can spin to any number, has pride of place. It must weigh about the same as a small car, so don't get any ideas." Instead of opening the safe, say "The safe opens only when turned to the correct combination."
	
	In the Safe is a silver florin. The Safe is closed and fixed in place. Understand "dial" as the Safe.
	
	Spinning it to is an action applying to one thing and one number. Check spinning it to: if the noun is not the Safe, say "[The noun] does not spin." instead. Report spinning it to: say "Click! and nothing else happens."
	
	Understand "spin [something] to [a number]" as spinning it to.
	
	After spinning the closed Safe to 1384: now the Safe is open; say "Clonk! and the safe door swings slowly open, revealing [a list of things in the Safe]."
	
	Test me with "open safe / spin safe to 1131 / open safe / spin safe to 1384 / x safe / get florin".
