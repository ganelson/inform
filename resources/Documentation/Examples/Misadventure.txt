^^{>GO: GO TO ROOM command}

The original Adventure allowed the player to type the names of rooms in order to move to them, and it is now not too difficult for us to do the same. Adventure restricted this option to adjacent rooms, but we might want to be a bit more flexible, so we will accept any room:

	{*}"Misadventure"
	
	Plover Room is a room. "You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light. An extremely narrow tunnel exits to the west. A dark corridor leads northeast."
	
	The Dark Corridor is northeast of Plover Room. Plover Room is south of the Dark Corridor. The printed name of the Dark Corridor is "Dark Room". The description of the Dark Corridor is "You're in the dark-room. A corridor leading south is the only exit."
	
	The Alcove is west of Plover Room. "You are in an alcove. A small northwest path seems to widen after a short distance. An extremely tight tunnel leads east. It looks like a very tight squeeze. An eerie light can be seen at the other end."
	
	Northwest of the Alcove is the Misty Cavern. The description of Misty Cavern is "You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern. Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be heard. The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling. The path exits to the south and west." West of Misty Cavern is the Alcove.
	
	Understand "[any room]" as going by name. Understand "go to [any room]" as going by name.
	
	Going by name is an action applying to one thing.

We should reject movement to the player's current location, or to anywhere they haven't been and can't see:

	{**}Check going by name:
		if the noun is the location, say "You're already in [the location]." instead;
		if the noun is not adjacent and the noun is unvisited, say "That noun did not make sense in this context." instead.

The assumption here is that the player does know the names of the rooms adjacent to their current location, even if they haven't been there yet.

Now for the travel itself. The simplest way to ensure that the usual movement rules will still apply is to convert ``GO BY [NAME]`` into a ``GO`` action, and here the best route comes to our aid:

	{**}Carry out going by name:
		let aim be the best route from the location to the noun, using doors;
		if aim is not a direction, say "You can't think how to get there from here." instead;
		say "(heading [aim])[command clarification break]";
		try going aim;
		if the location is not the noun, say "You'll have to stop here."

This will allow the player to travel toward rooms they have already visited even if they are several moves away.

Finally, so that the player can also use the names of doors as commands:

	{**}Understand "[door]" as entering.

And in keeping with the original, we might add to our scenario a rule or two about restrictions on movement, just to test that it's all working right:

	{**}The player carries a plover egg and a platinum pyramid. The description of the egg is "Plover's eggs, by the way, are quite large." The printed name of the egg is "emerald the size of a plover's egg". Understand "emerald" as the egg. The description of the pyramid is "The platinum pyramid is 8 inches on a side!"
	
	Instead of going to the Plover Room from the Alcove when the player carries something which is not the plover egg:
		say "Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you. You'd best take inventory and drop something."
	
	Test me with "go to misty cavern / go to dark corridor / go to plover room / go to alcove / go to dark corridor / drop pyramid / go to dark corridor / g / go to alcove / g / go to misty cavern".
