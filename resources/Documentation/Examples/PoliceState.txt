^^{Disorderly conduct}

	{*}"Police State"
	
	Seventh Avenue is a room. "The bars are all closed now, and there aren't any good clubs to go to, so you're on your own for open-air entertainment."
	
	Persuasion rule for asking the policeman to try doing something: persuasion fails.
	
	Persuasion rule for asking someone to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.

Note that the policeman will never get to the second persuasion rule, so he will always refuse to do the player's nefarious bidding.

	{**}Charles, Thomas, and Larry are men in Seventh Avenue. Patricia is a woman in Seventh Avenue.

And here's an unnecessary aesthetic touch from a later chapter, which will round up the descriptions of your friends into a single paragraph:

	{**}Rule for writing a paragraph about someone who is not the policeman:
		let X be the number of visible people who are not the policeman;
		say "It's just [X in words] of you now: [a list of visible people who are not the policeman]. But it sure has been a rip-roaring evening."
	
	The policeman is a man in Seventh Avenue. "A policeman with a very guarded expression is watching you."
	
	Singing is an action applying to nothing. Understand "sing" as singing.
	
	Report singing:
		say "A little the worse for wear, you sing."
	
	Smelling a person is disorderly conduct. Tasting a person is disorderly conduct. Jumping is disorderly conduct. Singing is disorderly conduct.
	
	Instead of someone trying disorderly conduct in the presence of the policeman:
		say "The policeman arrests [the person asked]!";
		now the person asked is nowhere;
		the rule succeeds.
	
	Instead of disorderly conduct in the presence of the policeman:
		end the story saying "The policeman arrests you!"
	
	Test me with "charles, look / charles, jump / look / policeman, sing / thomas, taste policeman / patricia, sing / look / jump".

Notice the difference between the two rules about disorderly conduct: the one for other people says 'the rule succeeds' to make sure that the action is counted as a success and not (as normally happens with instead rules) a failure. Most of the time we don't care whether actions are judged successes or failures, but it matters here, because if we type ``CHARLES, JUMP`` and the result fails, then text such as 'Charles is unable to.' will be printedâ€“which would get in the way. So we declare the action a success.
