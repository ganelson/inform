Example: * Whither?
Location: Understanding things by their relations
RecipeLocation: Doors, Staircases, and Bridges
Index: Door described and parsed differently depending on where it is
Description: A door whose description says where it leads; and which automatically understands references such as "the west door" and "the east door" depending on which direction it leads from the location.
For: Z-Machine

Here we expand on the simple examples [When?] and [Whence?]; this time we want the player to be able to refer to doors by their directions, as in ``THE WEST DOOR`` when the door in question does in fact lead west.

	{*}"Whither?"
	
	The temporal vortex is an open door. It is west of Yesterday and east of Today.
	
	The initial appearance of a door is usually "Nearby [an item described] leads [if the other side of the item described is visited][direction of the item described from the location] to [other side of the item described][otherwise][direction of the item described from the location][end if]."
	
	Direction-relevance relates a door (called X) to a direction (called Y) when the direction of X from the location is Y. The verb to be directionally-relevant to means the direction-relevance relation.
	
	Understand "[something related by direction-relevance] door" as a door.

As an added touch, we respond also to the case where the player postulates a door in some direction when there is no such thing at the moment:

	{**}Rule for printing a parser error when the player's command includes "[non-door direction] door":
		say "There is no door in that direction." instead.
	
	Definition: a direction (called direction D) is non-door:
		let the target be the room-or-door direction D from the location;
		if the target is a door:
			no;
		yes;
	
	Test me with "examine west door / x east door / w / x w door / x e door / tie me to the west door / tie the west door to me / push the west door east / push the east door west".
