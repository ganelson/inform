Example: * The Unbuttoned Elevator Affair
Location: One-way connections
RecipeLocation: Ships, Trains and Elevators
Index: An elevator operated simply by walking in and out
Description: A simple elevator connecting two floors which is operated simply by walking in and out, and has no buttons or fancy doors.
For: Z-Machine

^^{elevators (implementing): operated simply by walking in and out}

This is very simple. The interior of the elevator is a single room, but which is mapped east of both of its termini. The reverse map connection, west from the elevator, can only go to a single room, and that's what determines which floor the elevator is on.

	{*}"The Unbuttoned Elevator Affair"
	
	UNCLE Headquarters is a room. "The steel nerve-center of the free world's battle against the Technological Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity. Being against technology, we have only a very simple elevator to the east."
	
	Del Floria's Tailor Shop is a room. "Only trained anti-THRUSH agents recognise the booth in the east wall as a secret elevator."
	
	The Secret Elevator is east of UNCLE Headquarters. The Secret Elevator is east of Del Floria's Tailor Shop.
	
	After going to the Secret Elevator:
		say "The doors automatically close, there is a rush of motion, and they open again.";
		if UNCLE Headquarters is mapped west of the Secret Elevator:
			now Del Floria's Tailor Shop is mapped west of the Secret Elevator;
		otherwise:
			now UNCLE Headquarters is mapped west of the Secret Elevator;
		continue the action.
	
	Test me with "east / west / east / west".
