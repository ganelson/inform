Description: Redirecting a question about one topic to ask about another.
For: Z-Machine

^^{asking (actor) about+action+: a conversation topic other than the one the player typed}

Occasionally we will want to replace the player's question topic with another of our own devising. We can do this in the simplest possible case like so:

	{*}"Lucy"
	
	The International Boardgame Championship is a room. Lucy is a woman in the Championship.
	
	Instead of asking Lucy about "checkers":
		try asking Lucy about "games".
	
	Instead of asking Lucy about "games",
		say "'I don't like games,' she sniffs."
	
	Test me with "ask lucy about checkers / ask lucy about games".

Note that this syntax did not work in older versions of Inform; it is now safe.
