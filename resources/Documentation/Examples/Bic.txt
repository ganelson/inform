For: Z-Machine

It may occasionally be useful to check whether all objects in our game have a given property. Here we have a `not for release` section that will run at the start of the game and alert us to any objects lacking description:

	{*}"Bic"
	
	Section 1 - Testing descriptions - Not for release
	
	When play begins (this is the run property checks at the start of play rule):
		repeat with item running through things:
			if description of the item is "":
				say "[item] has no description."
	
	Section 2 - Story
	
	The Staff Break Room is a room.
	
	The player carries an orange, a Bic pen, and a napkin. The description of the orange is "It's a small hard pinch-skinned thing from the lunch room, probably with lots of pips and no juice."
	
	The description of the napkin is "Slightly crumpled."
