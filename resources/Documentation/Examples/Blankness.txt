^^{Blanking the status line before play}

Occasionally we want to print something as our first screen and then pause the game. By default, Inform will print a rather odd status line, with ``You`` on the left side and ``0`` on the right. This is because the left hand status line is set to display the location, but (because we're not done with the when-play-begins rules) the player has not yet even been moved to a room.

We can tidy this up in the `starting the virtual machine` activity, by temporarily changing the status line content. We will not provide game-pausing code here, because that is easily done by extension; so:

	{*}"Blankness"

	When play begins:
		say "take me home";
		wait for any key;
		say " yeah";
		wait for any key;
		say " yeah";
		pause the game;
		now the left hand status line is "[location]";
		now the right hand status line is "[turn count]".
	
	Before starting the virtual machine:
		now the left hand status line is "";
		now the right hand status line is "".
	
	Paradise City is a room. The description of Paradise City is "The grass is green and the girls are pretty."

Quite a modest effect, but occasionally useful.
