^^{Torch understood as flaming or extinguished}

	{*}"Hymenaeus"
	
	A torch is kind of thing. Understand the lit property as describing a torch. Understand "lighted" or "flaming" or "burning" as lit. Understand "extinguished" as unlit. A torch is usually lit.
	
	Before printing the name of a lit torch, say "flaming ".
	Before printing the name of an unlit torch, say "extinguished ".
	
	The Wedding Procession is a room.
	
	Orpheus is a man in the Wedding Procession. Orpheus carries a torch.
	Eurydice is a woman in the Wedding Procession. Eurydice carries a torch.
	
	Rule for writing a paragraph about someone (called target):
		say "[The target] carries [a list of things carried by the target]."
	
	Every turn:
		if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds and a torch is lit:
			let target torch be a random lit torch;
			now the target torch is unlit;
			say "Aquilo blows down from the north, extinguishing the torch carried by [the holder of the target torch]."
	
	Instead of examining a lit torch:
		say "It casts a bright glow over [the holder of the noun]."
	Instead of examining an unlit torch:
		say "[The holder of the noun] is looking at it disconsolately, obviously worried about the omens."
	
	Test me with "z / z / z / look / x flaming torch / x extinguished torch".
