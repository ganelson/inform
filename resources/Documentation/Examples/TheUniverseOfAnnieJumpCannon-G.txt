^^{kinds: of value}

In 1866 the Italian priest Angelo Secchi, having determined for the first time that the Sun was indeed a star, found a way to sort stars by their spectra, that is, by the blend of colours of light with which they shone. He used:

	A stellar type is a kind of value.
	Secchi class <class> specifies a stellar type with parts
		class (values "I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII").

At Harvard, Henry Draper and, more particularly, Edward Pickering carried out a larger survey and subdivided Secchi's classes so that there were now letters `A` to `Q`, with `A` to `D` being versions of `Secchi class I`, and so on. Exasperatingly, they omitted `J` but included `O`. Antonia Maury, the first woman to be credited as an astronomical observer, decided that `A` and `B` were the wrong way round, and moved back to Roman numbers, `I` to `XXII`.

Annie Jump Cannon brokered a compromise between Maury and Pickering. She reverted to letters, but ordered them better by what was now understood to be surface temperature, and grouped them simply as `O` (hottest), `B`, `A`, `F`, `G`, `K`, `M` (coolest): the traditional mnemonic being "oh be a fine girl, kiss me". Each class was subdivided 0 to 9, so that `G2` was closer to `G` than `K`, while `G9` was very nearly K-type.

In 1943 the action moved to Wisconsin, where the University of Chicago's Yerkes Observatory found a way to sort stars not by temperature but by luminosity: these classes were `0` (brightest), `Ia`, `Iab`, `Ib`, `II`, `III`, `IV`, `V`, `VI`, `VII` (dimmest).

Modern stellar classification is a combination:

	{*}"The Universe of Annie Jump Cannon"
	
	The Yerkes Observatory is a room.

	A temperature class is a kind of value. The temperature classes are O-type,
	B-type, A-type, F-type, G-type, K-type and M-type.

	A luminosity class is a kind of value. The luminosity classes are hypergiant,
	luminous supergiant, intermediate-size luminous supergiant, less luminous
	supergiant, bright giant, giant, subgiant, main-sequence, subdwarf and white
	dwarf.

	A stellar type is a kind of value. <class><temperature><luminosity> specifies a
	stellar type with parts
		class (values "O, B, A, F, G, K, M", corresponding to temperature classes),
		temperature (1 decimal digit, corresponding to a real number) and
		luminosity (values "0, Ia, Iab, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII", corresponding
			to luminosity classes).

In fact this is still a simplification because people sometimes subdivide
the number further or add "peculiarity" suffixes like `He wk`, or add extreme
additional types for truly odd stars, but it'll do.

Between 1910 and 1940 Annie Jump Cannon was to classify 350,000 stars by hand,
reaching a speed of three spectra per minute, a feat unequalled before or since.
Here's a smaller survey:

	{**}A star is a kind of thing. A star has a stellar type. Some stars are defined
	by the Table of Astral Survey Work.

	Table of Astral Survey Work
	name				stellar type
	S Monocerotis		O7V
	Rigel				B8Ia
	Deneb				A2Ia
	Zeta Leonis			F0III
	Beta Aquilae		G8IV
	Epsilon Eridani		K2V
	Herschel's Garnet	M2Ia

And stellar types, like other notations, can also be understood:

	{**}Observing is an action applying to one stellar type.

	Carry out observing: say "You observe a star of type [stellar type understood]."

	Understand "observe [stellar type]" as observing.

	Test me with "observe K9Iab / observe O00 / observe M9VII / observe F2Ia".

And to give this system a further workout:

	{**}To classify (star in question - a star):
		say "Annie Jump Cannon classifies [star in question] as [stellar type
		of the star in question]. 'Hm, yes - [luminosity part of stellar
		type of the star in question].'"

	When play begins:
		showme O00;
		showme O0Ia;
		showme K9Iab;
		showme the class part of K9Iab;
		showme the temperature part of K9Iab;
		showme the luminosity part of K9Iab;
		showme the stellar type with class part A-type temperature part 4.0 luminosity part subgiant;
		classify Beta Aquilae;
		classify Herschel's Garnet.

This all results in:

``` transcript
	stellar type: O00
	stellar type: O0Ia
	stellar type: K9Iab
	"class part of K9Iab" = temperature class: K-type
	"temperature part of K9Iab" = real number: 9.0
	"luminosity part of K9Iab" = luminosity class: intermediate-size luminous supergiant
	"stellar type with class part A-type temperature part 4.0 luminosity part subgiant" = stellar type: A4IV
	Annie Jump Cannon classifies Beta Aquilae as G8IV. "Hm, yes - subgiant."
	Annie Jump Cannon classifies Herschel's Garnet as M2Ia. "Hm, yes - luminous supergiant."

	Yerkes Observatory
	
	> OBSERVE K9IAB
	You observe a star of type K9Iab.
```

...and so on.
