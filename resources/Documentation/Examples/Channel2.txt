Index: Channel 2. Television with more advanced parsing
Description: Understanding channels (a number) in the names of televisions, with more sophisticated parsing of the change channel action.
For: Z-Machine

Our previous implementation of televisions ([Channel 1]) doesn't accept ``TUNE FIFTIES TELEVISION TO CHANNEL 4``; neither does it deal with player input like ``TUNE TO CHANNEL 4 ON FIFTIES TELEVISION``, nor ``TUNE TO CHANNEL 4`` where no television is specified.

When we are designing commands which involve two elements (here, a television and a channel number), it's usually a good idea to allow the player to specify those elements in either order, as we saw demonstrated briefly in [New commands for old grammar].

We might, therefore, want to add a few refinements: first by defining a `"[channel]"` token that will accept input of the forms `"[number]"` and "channel [number]", and second by creating some additional `Understand` lines that will accept variant versions of the player's input.

	Section 1 - Televisions in General
	
	A television is a kind of device.
	
	A television has a number called the channel. Understand the channel property as referring to a television. Understand "channel" as a television.
	
	Changing the channel of it to is an action applying to one thing and one number.
	
	Understand "tune [television] to [channel]" or "change channel of [television] to [channel]" as changing the channel of it to.
	
	Understand "tune [something] to [channel]" or "change channel of [something] to [channel]" as changing the channel of it to.
	
	Understand "tune to [channel] on [television]" or "change to [channel] on [television]" as changing the channel of it to (with nouns reversed).
	
	Understand "tune to [channel] on [something]" or "change to [channel] on [something]" as changing the channel of it to (with nouns reversed).
	
	Understand "[number]" or "channel [number]" as "[channel]".
	
	Check changing the channel of something to:
		if the noun is not a television, say "[The noun] cannot be tuned to a channel." instead.
	
	Carry out changing the channel of something to:
		now the channel of the noun is the number understood.
	
	Report changing the channel of something to:
		say "You tune [the noun] to channel [number understood]."
	
	Instead of examining a television:
		if the noun is switched off, say "[The noun] is currently turned off." instead;
		let the chosen channel be the channel of the noun;
		if the chosen channel is a current channel listed in the Table of Television Channels:
			choose row with current channel of the chosen channel in the Table of Television Channels;
			say "[output entry][paragraph break]";
		otherwise:
			say "Snow fills the screen of [the noun]."

	0	"The screen of [the noun] is completely black."
	
	Section 2 - The Scenario
	
	The Office is a room.
	
	The widescreen TV is a television in the Office. The fifties TV is a television in the Office.

And we add the scenario-specific content to our Table of Television Channels; in the case of channel 13, we provide for a changing sequence of events using text variations.

	Test me with "test one / test two".
	
	Test one with "change channel of fifties tv to 4 / x channel 4 / switch on fifties / x channel 4 / switch on widescreen / tune fifties tv to channel 5 / x channel 5 / x fifties tv / x channel 4".
	
	Test two with "tune to channel 13 / widescreen / tune channel 13 to channel 5 / tune channel 5 to channel 3 / widescreen / x channel 3".
