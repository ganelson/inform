	The Cabin is a room.  "The front of the small cabin is entirely occupied with navigational instruments, a radar display, and radios for calling back to shore. Along each side runs a bench with faded blue vinyl cushions[if the compartment is closed], which can be lifted to reveal the storage space underneath[otherwise], one of which is currently lifted to allow access to the storage compartment within[end if]. A glass case against the wall contains several fishing rods.
	
	Scratched windows offer a view of the surrounding bay, and there is a door south to the deck. A sign taped to one wall announces the menu of tours offered by the Yakutat Charter Boat Company."

The description of the cap is "It says, THE WORST DAY FISHING IS BETTER THAN THE BEST DAY WORKING." The captain carries the silver key. The description of the captain is "[The captain] is wearing [a list of things worn by the captain][if the captain carries something] and carrying [a list of things carried by the captain][end if]."

	The description of the radar is "Apparently necessary to avoid the larger icebergs."
	
	The description of the radios is "With any luck you will not need to radio for help, but it is reassuring that these things are here."

	The cabin door is south of the Cabin and north of the Deck. It is a door and scenery. The description of the Deck is "The whole back half of the boat is open, allowing you to view the surroundings without intervening windows -- if you can stand the cold."
	
	The ice chest is a closed openable container in the Deck. "A very heavy ice chest sits on the ground." It is fixed in place and pushable between rooms.
	
	A quantity of ice is in the Deck. "All around the boat bob chunks of glacier ice." Understand "glacier ice" as the quantity. The description is "Curiously cooled into funny-shaped chunks." The printed name of the quantity is "glacier ice".
	
	Instead of taking the quantity of ice when the player is not carrying the nets:

		say "You are having a hard time fishing out the ice with your bare hands."
	
	Instead of taking the quantity of ice when the player is carrying the nets:
		if the quantity of ice is handled or the quantity of ice is in the nets, continue the action;
		now the quantity of ice is in the nets;
		say "You scoop up the ice with the net."

	Instead of giving or showing a Coke to the Captain:
		say "'It needs chilling,' the Captain remarks, disgruntled."
	
	Instead of giving or showing a cold Coke to the Captain:
		move the Coke to the Captain;
		increase the score by 2;
		say "'Ah, thank you,' he says. How he can drink an iced soda on a day like today is an open question, but Alaskans are special."
	
	Every turn when the quantity of ice is in the ice chest:
		repeat with item running through beverages in the ice chest:
			let the current heat be the heat of the item;
			if the current heat is not cold, now the heat of the item is the heat before the current heat.

	After taking the fishing rods:
		end the story finally;
		increase the score by 3;
		say "Success is yours! (Now if only you knew anything about fishing.)"
