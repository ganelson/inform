Description: Offering the player a choice of numbered options at certain times, without otherwise interfering with their ability to give regular commands.
For: Z-Machine

Now and then in IF there is a situation where we need to ask the player for a numbered choice rather than an ordinary action command. What's more, that numbered choice might change during the game, so we don't want to just hard-wire the meanings of ``1``, ``2``, and ``3`` whenever the player types them.

A better trick is to keep a list or table (we'll use a table here because it involves slightly less overhead) recording what the player's numerical choices currently mean. Then every time the player selects a number, the table is consulted, and if the number corresponds to something, the player's choice is acted on.

In our example, we'll have a transporter pad that can take the player to any room in the story that they've already visited. (Just for the sake of example, we'll start him off with a few pre-visited rooms.)

	{*}"Down in Oodville"
	
	Section 1 - Method
	
	Understand "[number]" as selecting.
	
	Selecting is an action applying to one number.
	
	Check selecting: [assuming we don't want to be able to transport from just anywhere]
		if the player is not on the transporter pad:
			say "You can transport only from the transporter pad. From other places than the transporter room, you can HOME to your base ship, but not leap sideways to other locations.";
			empty the transport options instead.
	
	Check selecting:
		if the number understood is greater than the number of filled rows in the Table of Transport Options or the number understood is less than one:
			say "[The number understood] is not a valid option. ";
			list the transport options instead.
	
	Carry out selecting:
		let N be the number understood; [not actually a necessary step, but it makes the next line easier to understand]
		choose row N in the Table of Transport Options;
		if the transport entry is a room:
			move the player to the transport entry;
		otherwise:
			say "*** BUG: Improperly filled table of transport options ***" [It should not be possible for this to occur, but we add an error message for it so that, if it ever does, we will know what is causing the programming error in our code]
	
	To list the transport options:
		let N be 1;
		say "From here you could choose to go to: [line break]";
		repeat through the Table of Transport Options:
			say "  [N]: [transport entry][line break]";
			increment N.
	
	To empty the transport options:
		repeat through the Table of Transport Options:
			blank out the whole row; [first we empty the table]
	
	To load the transport options:
		repeat with interesting room running through visited rooms which are not the Transporter Room:
			choose a blank row in the Table of Transport Options;
			now the transport entry is the interesting room.
	
	Table of Transport Options
	transport
	an object
	with 3 blank rows. [In the current scenario, the number of blank rows need never be greater than the number of rooms in the game, minus the transport room itself.]
	
	Understand "home" as homing. Homing is an action applying to nothing.
	
	Check homing:
		if the player is in the Transporter Room:
			say "You're already here!" instead.
	
	Carry out homing:
		move the player to the transporter room.
	
	Section 2 - Scenario
	
	The Transporter Room is a room.
	
	Oodville is a visited room.
	
	Midnight is a visited room. The Diamond City is west of Midnight.
	
	The transporter pad is an enterable supporter in the Transporter Room. "The transporter pad in the middle of the floor is currently dull blue: powered but unoccupied."
	
	After entering the transporter pad:
		say "The transporter beeps and glows amber as you step onto its surface. A moment later a hologram displays your options. [run paragraph on]";
		empty the transport options;
		load the transport options;
		list the transport options.
	
	Test me with "get on pad / 0 / -1 / 8 / 2 / look / w / home / get on pad / get off pad / 3".

If we wanted to replace the regular command structure entirely with numbered menus, or use menus to hold conversation options, we could: several Inform extensions provide these functions.
