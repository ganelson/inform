<p>Inform is a team effort kept alive by the enthusiasm of a community of writers.<br><br>

The core software is by Graham Nelson, and the Examples and much of the design by Emily Short, with advice from Andrew Plotkin and others.<br><br>

The Mac OS X application was originally written by Andrew Hunter, and was rewritten in 2014 by Toby Nelson, building on Andrew's foundations. Corresponding apps for Windows and Linux are by David Kinder and Philip Chimento, and command-line tools for Linux, on a variety of processors, are maintained by Adam Thornton. David also maintains the Inform 6 code base, now used as a code-generator within Inform 7.<br><br>

The two virtual machines underlying Inform are the Z-machine, designed by Joel Berez, Marc Blank, Dave Lebling and others (and originally called the ZIP), and Glulx, a successor in the same general spirit, which was designed by Andrew Plotkin.<br><br>

Many people have generously shared their Extensions to Inform, and they're credited individually. But special thanks are due to Erik Temple, Dannii Willis, Aaron Reed, Ron Newcomb, Eric Eve and Juhana Leinonen for putting together the core of the Public Library. Mark Musante has been a tireless librarian of the extensions, and Justin de Vesine a great help in organising our forum.<br><br>

Literally thousands of people have filed bug reports or suggestions over the years. If you're one of them, sincere thanks to YOUR NAME HERE. Inform would never have got this far without you.
