<div id="welcome"><p>Welcome to the new Testing panel. This combines the old Skein and
Transcript panels. Like them, it records every play through the story. It helps with testing
because it compares the text this time with the &quot;blessed&quot; text on previous plays. The panel
shows oval &quot;knots&quot; representing turns of play.</p></div>

<div id="title" style="content: ''; clear: both; display: table;"><p><img style="float:left" src="inform://Skein/HelpStoryTitle.png"> The topmost knot is
the start position, representing the story before any choices are made.</p></div>

<div id="purple" style="content: ''; clear: both; display: table;"><p><img style="float:left" src="inform://Skein/HelpPurpleKnot.png">
The purple knot marks the position reached at any given moment in the Story panel.</p></div>

<div id="grey" style="content: ''; clear: both; display: table;"><p><img style="float:left" src="inform://Skein/HelpGreyKnot.png"> Each
grey knot represents a command typed in, and the text which resulted. Grey means it's not
selected: click it to select.</p></div>

<div id="blue" style="content: ''; clear: both; display: table;"><p><img style="float:left" src="inform://Skein/HelpBlueKnot.png"> A blue
knot is a grey knot that has been selected. Click it again to unselect.</p></div>

<div id="report" style="content: ''; clear: both; display: table;"><p>The yellow box shows the text produced the last time the selected (blue
knot) commands were typed in. The arrows show which command led to what.</p></div>

<div id="tick" style="content: ''; clear: both; display: table;"><p>Text is automatically compared against an earlier version known to be
correct, called the &quot;blessed&quot; version.

<p><img style="float:left" src="inform://Skein/Trans-tick-off.png">&nbsp;The tick icon
is shown if that turn's text failed to match. Green highlighting shows text added since the
&quot;blessed&quot; version, red highlighting shows text removed. (All green must mean there's no
&quot;blessed&quot; version, so that all text is new.) If you agree that the current text is correct,
click the tick icon. If you don't agree, you'll need to rewrite your story to produce
different text next time.</div>

<div id="cross" style="content: ''; clear: both; display: table;"><p><img style="float:left" src="inform://Skein/Trans-cross-off.png">
&nbsp;The cross icon is only shown if that turn's text was correct, that is, if it exactly
matched the "blessed" version. Click the cross to "curse" the turn - that removes the blessing.</p></div>

<div id="badge" style="content: ''; clear: both; display: table;"><p><img style="float:left" src="inform://Skein/HelpBadgedBlueKnot.png">
The red star on a knot means that the text definitely had a &quot;blessed&quot; version but that the
most recent play failed to match it - so this is a knot where there's a problem.</p></div>

<div id="threads" style="content: ''; clear: both; display: table;"><p>The black &quot;threads&quot; between the knots show the sequence of play. Time runs
downwards, so later turns are below earlier ones.</p></div>

<div id="knots" style="content: ''; clear: both; display: table;"><p>Once a turn is played in the Story panel, by typing in a command, another knot will appear here.</p></div>

<div id="moreknots" style="content: ''; clear: both; display: table;"><p>As more turns are played in the Story panel, more knots will appear here.</p></div>

<div id="menu" style="content: ''; clear: both; display: table;"><p><img style="float:left" src="inform://Skein/HelpGreyKnotMenu.png"> Hover the mouse over a knot to see the
    pop-up menu button for it - clicking this gives more advanced options.</p></div>

<div id="welcomead" style="content: ''; clear: both; display: table;"><p>In addition to Hide/Show Help, the top of this panel has two buttons for advanced users. Save Transcript
lets you save out the text from the currently selected thread of play. Play All
systematically plays through every variation in the diagram, restarting the story
as needed to do so, so that it tests every knot.</p></div>
