[RTPhrasebook::] Phrasebook Index.

Compiling what amounts to the Phrasebook index into the Inter hierarchy.

@ The Phrasebook index cannot be generated from the Inter hierarchy simply
by observing the function definitions in it, because of the existence of
implicit phrases, polymorphic phrases and so on. It needs just too much
understanding of the situation which only the top- and mid-levels of the
compiler have.

So we compile what amounts to a structured version of this index element
directly into the Inter code, for retrieval later when the actual index
HTML page is written.

The divisions (which look like headings on the Index, but we don't call them
that to avoid confusion with source text headings) correspond to the
extensions in which phrases are defined. If $N$ extensions were included
then there are divisions $0, 1, ..., N$, where $0, ..., N-1$ correspond
to the extensions in inclusion order, with the Standard Rules being division 0.
Division $N$ represents the source text itself.

The subdivisions (in effect subheadings on the Index) correspond to headings,
within the divisions, under which phrases are defined. Note that some headings
suppress indexing of their definitions.

@ The Standard Rules contain such a profusion of phrase definitions that,
without making use of subheadings, the Phrasebook Index would be a shapeless
list in which it was impossible to find things.

So the indexer in fact looks at headings in the source text and attempts
to group definitions by them. In particular, in the Standard Rules, it looks
for headings with this form:

>> Blah blah blah - Major title - Minor title

For example, we might have

>> Section SR5/3/2 - Control phrases - While

which would match the first production below. The first piece is discarded,
and the second and third pieces used as headings and subheadings respectively.

=
<heading-with-parenthesis> ::=
	{<heading-name-hyphenated>} ( <definite-article> ... ) |
	{<heading-name-hyphenated>} ( ... ) |
	{<heading-name-hyphenated>}

<heading-name-hyphenated> ::=
	... - ... - ... |    ==> { 3, - }
	... - ... |          ==> { 2, - }
	...                  ==> { 1, - }

@ We then extract "Control phrases" as the "clue".
