Actions.

The standard stock of actions, along with the rules which define them; and
the command grammar which requests them.

@ Inform comes with no actions built in, and Basic Inform defines none either.
The compiler makes only one (perhaps unexpected) assumption: that the 8th
action defined is "going".

The order, and the subheadings, here are responsible for the order
and subheadings used in the Actions page of the Index.

Section 2 - Standard actions concerning the actor's possessions

Taking inventory is an action applying to nothing.
The taking inventory action is accessible to Inter as "Inv".

The specification of the taking inventory action is "Taking an inventory of
one's immediate possessions: the things being carried, either directly or in
any containers being carried. When the player performs this action, either
the inventory listing, or else a special message if nothing is being carried
or worn, is printed during the carry out rules: nothing happens at the report
stage. The opposite happens for other people performing the action: nothing
happens during carry out, but a report such as 'Mr X looks through his
possessions.' is produced (provided Mr X is visible)."

@ There used to be a rule, documented here, to do with pronouns, and
this was explained in terms of Missee Lee, a black and white cat
living in North Oxford; named for a Cambridge-educated pirate queen in
the South China seas who is the heroine -- or villainess -- of the
tenth in Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons series of children's
books, "Missee Lee" (1941). The rule was then removed, but it
seemed sad to delete the only mention of Missee, and all the more so
since she died (at a grand old age and in mid-spring) in 2008.

	say "[We] [are] carrying:[line break]" (A);
	now all things enclosed by the player are unmarked for listing;

@h Taking.

=
Taking is an action applying to one thing.
The taking action is accessible to Inter as "Take".

The specification of the taking action is "The taking action is the only way
an action in the Standard Rules can cause something to be carried by an actor.
It is very simple in operation (the entire carry out stage consists only of
'now the actor carries the noun') but many checks must be performed before it
can be allowed to happen."

		stop the action.

Check an actor taking (this is the use player's holdall to avoid exceeding
	carrying capacity rule):
	if the number of things carried by the actor is at least the
		carrying capacity of the actor:
		if the actor is holding a player's holdall (called the current working sack):
			let the transferred item be nothing;
			repeat with the possible item running through things carried by
				the actor:
				if the possible item is not lit and the possible item is not
					the current working sack, let the transferred item be the possible item;

		otherwise:
			say "[The actor] [pick] up [the noun]." (B).

@h Removing it from.

=
Removing it from is an action applying to two things.
The removing it from action is accessible to Inter as "Remove".

The specification of the removing it from action is "Removing is not really
an action in its own right. Whereas there are many ways to put something down
(on the floor, on top of something, inside something else, giving it to
somebody else, and so on), Inform has only one way to take something: the
taking action. Removing exists only to provide some nicely worded replies
to impossible requests, and in all sensible cases is converted into taking.
Because of this, it's usually a bad idea to write rules about removing:
if you write a rule such as 'Instead of removing the key, ...' then it
won't apply if the player simply types TAKE KEY instead. The safe way to
do this is to write a rule about taking, which covers all possibilities."

@ Check.

=
Check an actor removing something from (this is the can't remove what's not inside rule):
	if the holder of the noun is not the second noun:
		if the actor is the player:
			say "But [regarding the noun][they] [aren't] there [now]." (A);
		stop the action.

Check an actor removing something from (this is the can't remove from people rule):

			say "[regarding the noun][Those] [seem] to belong to [the owner]." (A);
		stop the action.

Check an actor removing something from (this is the convert remove to take rule):
	convert to the taking action on the noun.

The can't take component parts rule is listed before the can't remove what's not
inside rule in the check removing it from rules.

@h Dropping.

=
Dropping is an action applying to one thing.
The dropping action is accessible to Inter as "Drop".

The specification of the dropping action is "Dropping is one of five actions
by which an actor can get rid of something carried: the others are inserting
(into a container), putting (onto a supporter), giving (to someone else) and
eating. Dropping means dropping onto the actor's current floor, which is
usually the floor of a room - but might be the inside of a box if the actor
is also inside that box, and so on.

The can't drop clothes being worn rule silently tries the taking off action
on any clothing being dropped: unlisting this rule removes both this behaviour
and also the requirement that clothes cannot simply be dropped."

@ Check.

Rules can then get at it again.

Note that, uncontroversially, one can only eat things with the 'edible'
either/or property. Until 2011, the action also required that the foodstuff
had to be carried by the eater, which meant that a player standing next
to a bush with berries who typed EAT BERRIES would force a '(first taking
the berries)' action. This is no longer true. Taking is now only forced if

Section 3 - Standard actions which move the actor

Going is an action applying to one visible thing.
The going action is accessible to Inter as "Go".

The specification of the going action is "This is the action which allows people
to move from one room to another, using whatever map connections and doors are
to hand. The Standard Rules are written so that the noun can be either a
direction or a door in the location of the actor: while the player's commands
only lead to going actions with directions as nouns, going actions can also
happen as a result of entering actions, and then the noun can indeed be
a door."

The going action has a room called the room gone from (matched as "from").
The going action has an object called the room gone to (matched as "to").
The going action has an object called the door gone through (matched as "through").
The going action has an object called the vehicle gone by (matched as "by").

@h Entering.

=
Entering is an action applying to one thing.
The entering action is accessible to Inter as "Enter".

The specification of the entering action is "Whereas the going action allows
people to move from one location to another in the model world, the entering
action is for movement inside a location: for instance, climbing into a cage
or sitting on a couch. (Entering is not allowed to change location, so any
attempt to enter a door is converted into a going action.) What makes
entering trickier than it looks is that the player may try to enter an
object which is itself inside, or part of, something else, which might in
turn be... and so on. To preserve realism, the implicitly pass through other
barriers rule automatically generates entering and exiting actions needed
to pass between anything which might be in the way: for instance, in a
room with two open cages, an actor in cage A who tries entering cage B first
has to perform an exiting action."

Rule for supplying a missing noun while entering (this is the find what to enter
rule):

@h Exiting.

=
Exiting is an action applying to nothing.
The exiting action is accessible to Inter as "Exit".
The exiting action has an object called the container exited from (matched as "from").

The specification of the exiting action is "Whereas the going action allows
people to move from one location to another in the model world, and the
entering action is for movement deeper inside the objects in a location,
the exiting action is for movement back out towards the main floor area.
Climbing out of a cupboard, for instance, is an exiting action. Exiting
when already in the main floor area of a room with a map connection to
the outside is converted to a going action. Finally, note that whereas
entering works for either containers or supporters, exiting is purely for
getting oneself out of containers: if the actor is on top of a supporter
instead, an exiting action is converted to the getting off action."

@h Getting off.

=
Getting off is an action applying to one thing.
The getting off action is accessible to Inter as "GetOff".

The specification of the getting off action is "The getting off action is for
actors who are currently on top of a supporter: perhaps standing on a platform,
but maybe only sitting on a chair or even lying down in bed. Unlike the similar

@h Looking.

=
Section 4 - Standard actions concerning the actor's vision

Looking is an action applying to nothing.
The looking action is accessible to Inter as "Look".

The specification of the looking action is "The looking action describes the
player's current room and any visible items, but is made more complicated
by the problem of visibility. Inform calculates this by dividing the room
into visibility levels. For an actor on the floor of a room, there is only
one such level: the room itself. But an actor sitting on a chair inside
a packing case which is itself on a gantry would have four visibility levels:
chair, case, gantry, room. The looking rules use a special phrase, 'the
visibility-holder of X', to go up from one level to the next: thus the
visibility-holder of the case is the gantry.

The 'visibility level count' is the number of levels which the player can
actually see, and the 'visibility ceiling' is the uppermost visible level.
For a player standing on the floor of a lighted room, this will be a count
of 1 with the ceiling set to the room. But a player sitting on a chair in
a closed opaque packing case would have visibility level count 2, and
visibility ceiling equal to the case. Moreover, light has to be available
in order to see anything at all: if the player is in darkness, the level
count is 0 and the ceiling is nothing.

Finally, note that several actions other than looking also produce room
descriptions in some cases. The most familiar is going, but exiting a
container or getting off a supporter will also generate a room description.
(The phrase used by the relevant rules is 'produce a room description with
going spacing conventions' and carry out or report rules for newly written
actions are welcome to use this too if they would like to. The spacing
conventions affect paragraph division, and note that the main description
paragraph may be omitted for a place not newly visited, depending on the
VERBOSE settings.) Room descriptions like this are produced by running the
check, carry out and report rules for looking, but are not subject to
before, instead or after rules: so they do not count as a new action. The
looking variable 'room-describing action' holds the action name of the
reason a room description is currently being made: if the player typed
LOOK, this will indeed be set to the looking action, but if we're
describing a room just reached by GO EAST, say, it will be set to the going
action. This can be used to customise carry out looking rules so that
different forms of description are used on going to a room as compared with
looking around while already there."

The looking action has an action name called the room-describing action.
The looking action has a truth state called abbreviated form allowed.
The looking action has a number called the visibility level count.
The looking action has an object called the visibility ceiling.

Setting action variables for looking (this is the determine visibility ceiling
	rule):
	if the actor is the player, calculate visibility ceiling at low level;
	now the visibility level count is the visibility ceiling count calculated;
	now the visibility ceiling is the visibility ceiling calculated;
	now the room-describing action is the looking action.

@h Examining.

=
Examining is an action applying to one visible thing and requiring light.
The examining action is accessible to Inter as "Examine".

The specification of the examining action is "The act of looking closely at
something. Note that the noun could be either a direction or a thing, which
is why the Standard Rules include the 'examine directions rule' to deal with
directions: it simply says 'You see nothing unexpected in that direction.'
and stops the action. (If you would like to handle directions differently,
list another rule instead of this one in the carry out examining rules.)

Some things have no description property, or rather, have only a blank text
as one. It's possible that something interesting may be said anyway (see
the rules for directions, containers, supporters and devices), but if not,
we give up with a bland response. This is done by the examine undescribed
things rule."

The examining action has a truth state called examine text printed.

@ Carry out.

@h Looking under.

=
Looking under is an action applying to one visible thing and requiring light.
The looking under action is accessible to Inter as "LookUnder".

The specification of the looking under action is "The standard Inform world
model does not have a concept of things being under other things, so this
action is only minimally provided by the Standard Rules, but it exists here
for traditional reasons (and because, after all, LOOK UNDER TABLE is the
sort of command which ought to be recognised even if it does nothing useful).
The action ordinarily either tells the player that they find nothing of
interest, or reports that somebody else has looked under something.

The usual way to make this action do something useful is to write a rule
like 'Instead of looking under the cabinet for the first time: now the
player has the silver key; say ...' and so on."

@ Carry out.

@h Searching.

=
Searching is an action applying to one thing and requiring light.
The searching action is accessible to Inter as "Search".

The specification of the searching action is "Searching looks at the contents
of an open or transparent container, or at the items on top of a supporter.
These are often mentioned in room descriptions already, and then the action
is unnecessary, but that wouldn't be true for something like a kitchen
cupboard which is scenery - mentioned in passing in a room description, but
not made a fuss of. Searching such a cupboard would then, by listing its
contents, give the player more information than the ordinary room description
shows.

The usual check rules restrict searching to containers and supporters: so
the Standard Rules do not allow the searching of people, for instance. But
it is easy to add instead rules ('Instead of searching Dr Watson: ...') or
even a new carry out rule ('Check searching someone (called the suspect): ...')
to extend the way searching normally works."

@h Consulting it about.

=
Consulting it about is an action applying to one thing and one topic.
The consulting it about action is accessible to Inter as "Consult".

The specification of the consulting it about action is "Consulting is a very
flexible and potentially powerful action, but only because it leaves almost
all of the work to the author to deal with directly. The idea is for it to
respond to commands such as LOOK UP HENRY FITZROY IN HISTORY BOOK, where
the topic would be the snippet of command HENRY FITZROY and the thing would
be the book.

The Standard Rules simply parry such requests by saying that the player finds
nothing of interest. All interesting responses must be provided by the author,
using rules like 'Instead of consulting the history book about...'"

@h Locking it with.

=
Section 5 - Standard actions which change the state of things

Locking it with is an action applying to one thing and one carried thing.
The locking it with action is accessible to Inter as "Lock".

The specification of the locking it with action is "Locking is the act of
using an object such as a key to ensure that something such as a door or
container cannot be opened unless first unlocked. (Only closed things can be
locked.)

Locking can be performed on any kind of thing which provides the either/or
properties lockable, locked, openable and open. The 'can't lock without a lock
rule' tests to see if the noun both provides the lockable property, and if
it is in fact lockable: it is then assumed that the other properties can
safely be checked. In the Standard Rules, the container and door kinds both
satisfy these requirements.

We can create a new kind on which opening, closing, locking and unlocking
will work thus: 'A briefcase is a kind of thing. A briefcase can be openable.
A briefcase can be open. A briefcase can be lockable. A briefcase can be
locked. A briefcase is usually openable, lockable, open and unlocked.'

Inform checks whether the key fits using the 'can't lock without the correct
key rule'. To satisfy this, the actor must be directly holding the second
noun, and it must be the current value of the 'matching key' property for
the noun. (This property is seldom referred to directly because it is
automatically set by assertions like 'The silver key unlocks the wicket
gate.')

The Standard Rules provide locking and unlocking actions at a fairly basic
level: they can be much enhanced using the extension Locksmith by Emily
Short, which is included with all distributions of Inform."

The specification of the unlocking it with action is "Unlocking undoes the

it is in fact lockable: it is then assumed that the other properties can
safely be checked. In the Standard Rules, the container and door kinds both
satisfy these requirements.

We can create a new kind on which opening, closing, locking and unlocking
will work thus: 'A briefcase is a kind of thing. A briefcase can be openable.
A briefcase can be open. A briefcase can be lockable. A briefcase can be
locked. A briefcase is usually openable, lockable, open and unlocked.'

Inform checks whether the key fits using the 'can't unlock without the correct
key rule'. To satisfy this, the actor must be directly holding the second
noun, and it must be the current value of the 'matching key' property for
the noun. (This property is seldom referred to directly because it is
automatically set by assertions like 'The silver key unlocks the wicket
gate.')

The Standard Rules provide locking and unlocking actions at a fairly basic
level: they can be much enhanced using the extension Locksmith by Emily
Short, which is included with all distributions of Inform."

(It is assumed that anything which can be openable can also be open.)
In the Standard Rules, the container and door kinds both satisfy these
requirements.

In the event that the thing to be opened is also lockable, we are forbidden
to open it when it is locked. Both containers and doors can be lockable,
but the opening and closing actions would also work fine with kinds which
cannot be.

We can create a new kind on which opening and closing will work thus:
'A case file is a kind of thing. A case file can be openable.
A case file can be open. A case file is usually openable and closed.'

The meaning of open and closed is different for different kinds of thing.
When a container is closed, that means people outside cannot reach in,
and vice versa; when a door is closed, people cannot use the 'going' action
to pass through it. If we were to create a new kind such as 'case file',

@h Giving it to.

=
Section 6 - Standard actions concerning other people

Giving it to is an action applying to one carried thing and one thing.
The giving it to action is accessible to Inter as "Give".

The specification of the giving it to action is "This action is indexed by
Inform under 'Actions concerning other people', but it could just as easily
have gone under 'Actions concerning the actor's possessions' because -
like dropping, putting it on or inserting it into - this is an action
which gets rid of something being carried.

The Standard Rules implement this action fully - if it reaches the carry
out and report rulebooks, then the item is indeed transferred to the
recipient, and this is properly reported. But giving something to
somebody is not like putting something on a shelf: the recipient has
to agree. The final check rule, the 'block giving rule', assumes that
the recipient does not consent - so the gift fails to happen. The way
to make the giving action use its abilities fully is to replace the
block giving rule with a rule which makes a more sophisticated decision
about who will accept what from whom, and only blocks some attempts,
letting others run on into the carry out and report rules."

Showing it to is an action applying to one carried thing and one visible thing.
The showing it to action is accessible to Inter as "Show".

The specification of the showing it to action is "Anyone can show anyone
else something which they are carrying, but not some nearby piece of
scenery, say - so this action is suitable for showing the emerald locket
to Katarina, but not showing the Orange River Rock Room to Mr Douglas.

The Standard Rules implement this action in only a minimal way, checking
that it makes sense but then blocking all such attempts with a message
such as 'Katarina is not interested.' - this is the task of the 'block
showing rule'. As a result, there are no carry out or report rules. To
make it into a systematic and interesting action, we would need to
unlist the block showing rule and then to write carry out and report
rules: but usually for IF purposes we only need to make a handful of
special cases of showing work properly, and for those we can simply
write Instead rules to handle them."

The waking action is accessible to Inter as "WakeOther".

The specification of the waking action is "This is the act of jostling
a sleeping person to wake them up, and it finds its way into the Standard
Rules only for historical reasons. Inform does not by default provide
any model for people being asleep or awake, so this action doesnot do
anything in the standard implementation: instead, it is always stopped by
the block waking rule."

@h Throwing it at.

=
Throwing it at is an action applying to one carried thing and one visible thing.
The throwing it at action is accessible to Inter as "ThrowAt".

The specification of the throwing it at action is "Throwing something at
someone or something is difficult for Inform to model. So many considerations
apply: just because the actor can see the target, does it follow that the
target can accurately hit it? What if the projectile is heavy, like an
anvil, or something not easily aimable, like a feather? What if there
is a barrier in the way, like a cage with bars spaced so that only items
of a certain size get through? And then: what should happen as a result?
Will the projectile break, or do damage, or fall to the floor, or into
a container or onto a supporter? And so on.

Because it seems hopeless to try to model this in any general way,
Inform instead provides the action for the user to attach specific rules to.
The check rules in the Standard Rules simply require that the projectile
is not an item of clothing still worn (this will be relevant for women
attending a Tom Jones concert) but then, in either the 'futile to throw
things at inanimate objects rule' or the 'block throwing at rule', will
refuse to carry out the action with a bland message.

To make throwing do something, then, we must either write Instead rules
for special circumstances, or else unlist these check rules and write
suitable carry out and report rules to pick up the thread."

The attacking action is accessible to Inter as "Attack".

The specification of the attacking action is "Violence is seldom the answer,
and attempts to attack another person are normally blocked as being unrealistic
or not seriously meant. (I might find a shop assistant annoying, but IF is
not Grand Theft Auto, and responding by killing them is not really one of
my options.) So the Standard Rules simply block attempts to fight people,

=
Answering it that is an action applying to one thing and one topic.
The answering it that action is accessible to Inter as "Answer".

The specification of the answering it that action is "The Standard Rules do

set up so that it is as easy as we can make it to write specific rules

written then all attempts to communicate are gracefully if not very
interestingly rejected.

The topic here can be any double-quoted text, which can itself contain
tokens in square brackets: see the documentation on Understanding.

Answering is an action existing so that the player can say something free-form
to somebody else. A convention of IF is that a command such as DAPHNE, TAKE
MASK is a request to Daphne to perform an action: if the persuasion rules in
force mean that she consents, the action 'Daphne taking the mask' does
indeed then result. But if the player types DAPHNE, 12375 or DAPHNE, GREAT
HEAVENS - or anything else not making sense as a command - the action
'answering Daphne that ...' will be generated.

The name of the action arises because it is also caused by typing, say,
ANSWER 12375 when Daphne (say) has asked a question."

of the genre that Mary should not be expected to respond in cases where
there is no reason to suppose that she has anything relevant to pass on -
ASK JANE ABOUT RICE PUDDING, for instance, need not conjure up a recipe

It is an action so that rules can be attached to it: for instance, we could
imagine that a player who consciously decides to sit and wait might notice
something which a busy player does not, and we could write a rule accordingly.

Note the absence of check or carry out rules - anyone can wait, at any time,
and it makes nothing happen."

rules because nothing in the standard Inform world model reacts to
a mere touch - though report rules do mean that attempts to touch other
people provoke a special reply."

@ There's really no very good reason why we provide the out-of-world command
SCORE but not (say) TIME, or any one of dozens of other traditional what's-my-status
commands: DIAGNOSE, say, or PLACES. But we are conservative on this; it's easy
for users or extensions to provide these verbs if they want them, and they are
not always appropriate for every project. Even SCORE is questionable, but its
removal would be a gesture too far.
