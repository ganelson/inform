Phrase Definitions.

Additional phrases to do with interactive fiction, to add to the much larger
collection provided by Basic Inform; and the final sign-off of the Standard
Rules extension, including its minimal documentation.

@ The following is inevitably a bit of a miscellany. Firstly, there's no
model of the passage of time in Basic Inform, so:

=
Part Seven - Phrasebook

Chapter 1 - Saying

Section 1 - Time Values

To say (something - time) in words
	(documented at phs_timewords):
	(- print (PrintTimeOfDayEnglish) {something}; -).
To say here
	(documented at phs_here):
	say "[if story tense is present tense]here[otherwise]there".
To say now
	(documented at phs_now):
	say "[if story tense is present tense]now[otherwise]then".

@ The ability to put up a dinky reverse-video quotation as an epigraph
has somehow survived for 36 years. The decision to continue to support it
even in Inform 6 was critiqued as being an unnecessary throwback by Jimmy
Maher in 2019; he was clearly right; and yet here we are, and it survives
even the 2020 restructuring of Inform's language design.

=
Section 2 - Boxed quotations

To display the boxed quotation (Q - text)
	(documented at ph_boxed):
	(- DisplayBoxedQuotation({-box-quotation-text:Q}); -).

@ And now some oddball special texts which must sometimes be said.

=
Section 3 - Some built-in texts

To say the/-- banner text
	(documented at phs_banner):
	(- Banner(); -).
To say the/-- list of extension credits
	(documented at phs_extcredits):
	(- ShowExtensionVersions(); -).
To say the/-- complete list of extension credits
	(documented at phs_compextcredits):
	(- ShowFullExtensionVersions(); -).
To say the/-- player's surroundings
	(documented at phs_surroundings):
	(- SL_Location(true); -).
To say run paragraph on with special look spacing -- running on
	(documented at phs_runparaonsls):
	(- SpecialLookSpacingBreak(); -).
To say command clarification break -- running on
	(documented at phs_clarifbreak):
	(- CommandClarificationBreak(); -).

@ Recall that this activity exists only in the Standard Rules, and therefore
this phrase definition must similarly be here, not in Basic Inform.

=
Section 4 - Responses

To say text of (R - response)
	(documented at phs_response):
	carry out the issuing the response text activity with R.

@h Using the list-writer.
One of the most powerful features of Inform 6 was its list-writer, a lengthy
piece of I6 code which now lives on as Inter code, in the |srules| template:
see "ListWriter.i6t". The following phrases control it:

=
Section 5 - Saying lists of things

To list the contents of (O - an object),
	with newlines,
	indented,
	giving inventory information,
	as a sentence,
	including contents,
	including all contents,
	tersely,
	giving brief inventory information,
	using the definite article,
	listing marked items only,
	prefacing with is/are,
	not listing concealed items,
	suppressing all articles,
	with extra indentation,
	and/or capitalized
	(documented at ph_listcontents):
	(- WriteListFrom(child({O}), {phrase options}); -).

@ These text substitutions all look (and are) repetitive. We want to avoid
passing a description value to some routine, because that's tricky if the
description needs to refer to a value local to the current stack frame. (There
are ways round that, but it minimises nuisance to avoid the need.) So we mark
out the set of objects matching by giving them, and only them, the |workflag2|
attribute.

=
To say a list of (OS - description of objects)
	(documented at phs_alistof): (-
	 	objectloop({-my:1} ofclass Object)

			else

		WriteListOfMarkedObjects(ENGLISH_BIT+RECURSE_BIT+PARTINV_BIT+
			TERSE_BIT+CONCEAL_BIT);
	-).

@h Grouping in the list-writer.
See the specifications of |list_together| and |c_style| in the DM4, which are
still broadly accurate.

=
Section 6 - Group in and omit from lists

To group (OS - description of objects) together
	(documented at ph_group): (-
		objectloop({-my:1} provides list_together)
			if ({-matches-description:1:OS})
				CopyPV({-my:1}.list_together, {-list-together:unarticled});
	-).
To group (OS - description of objects) together giving articles
	(documented at ph_groupart): (-
		objectloop({-my:1} provides list_together)
			if ({-matches-description:1:OS})
				CopyPV({-my:1}.list_together, {-list-together:articled});
	-).
To group (OS - description of objects) together as (T - text)
	(documented at ph_grouptext): (-
		{-my:2} = CreatePV(TEXT_TY);
		{-my:2} = TEXT_TY_SubstitutedForm({-my:2}, {-by-reference:T});
		objectloop({-my:1} provides list_together)
			if ({-matches-description:1:OS})
				CopyPV({-my:1}.list_together, {-my:2});
		DestroyPV({-my:2});
	-).
To omit contents in listing
	(documented at ph_omit):
	(- c_style = c_style &~ (RECURSE_BIT+FULLINV_BIT+PARTINV_BIT); -).

@h Filtering in the list-writer.
Something of a last resort, which is intentionally not documented.
It's needed by the Standard Rules to tidy up an implementation and
avoid I6, but is not an ideal trick and may be dropped in later
builds. Recursion occurs when the list-writer descends to the contents
of, or items supported by, something it lists. Here we can restrict to
just those contents, or supportees, matching a description |D|.

=
Section 7 - Filtering contents of lists - Unindexed

To filter list recursion to (D - description of objects):
	(- list_filter_routine = {D}; -).
To unfilter list recursion:
	(- list_filter_routine = 0; -).

@h Figures and sound effects.

=
Chapter 2 - Multimedia

Section 1 - Figures (for figures language element only)

To display (F - figure name), one time only
	(documented at ph_displayfigure):
	(- DisplayFigure(ResourceIDsOfFigures-->{F}, {phrase options}); -).
To decide which number is the Glulx resource ID of (F - figure name)
	(documented at ph_figureid):
	(- ResourceIDsOfFigures-->{F} -).

Section 2 - Sound effects (for sounds language element only)

To play (SFX - sound name), one time only
	(documented at ph_playsf):
	(- PlaySound(ResourceIDsOfSounds-->{SFX}, {phrase options}); -).
To decide which number is the Glulx resource ID of (SFX - sound name)
	(documented at ph_soundid):
	(- ResourceIDsOfSounds-->{SFX} -).

@h Actions, activities and rules.
We begin with the firing off of new actions. The current action runs silently
if the I6 global variable |keep_silent| is set, so the result of the
definitions below is that one can go into silence mode, using "try silently",
but not climb out of it again. This is done because many actions try other
actions as part of their normal workings: if we want action $X$ to be tried
silently, then any action $X$ itself tries should also be tried silently.

=
Chapter 3 - Actions, activities and rules

Section 1 - Trying actions

To try (S - action)
	(documented at ph_try):
	(- {-try-action:S} -).
To silently try (S - action)
	(documented at ph_trysilently):
	(- {-try-action-silently:S} -).
To try silently (S - action)
	(documented at ph_trysilently):
	(- {-try-action-silently:S} -).
To decide whether the action is not silent:
	(- (keep_silent == false) -).

@ The requirements of the current action can be tested. The following
may be reimplemented using a verb "to require" at some future point.

=
Section 2 - Action requirements

To decide whether the action requires a touchable noun
	(documented at ph_requirestouch):
	(- (NeedToTouchNoun()) -).
To decide whether the action requires a touchable second noun
	(documented at ph_requirestouch2):
	(- (NeedToTouchSecondNoun()) -).
To decide whether the action requires a carried noun
	(documented at ph_requirescarried):
	(- (NeedToCarryNoun()) -).
To decide whether the action requires a carried second noun
	(documented at ph_requirescarried2):
	(- (NeedToCarrySecondNoun()) -).
To decide whether the action requires light
	(documented at ph_requireslight):
	(- (NeedLightForAction()) -).

To anonymously abide by (RL - a rule)
	(documented at ph_abideanon):
	(- if (temporary_value = FollowRulebook({RL})) {
		if (RulebookSucceeded()) ActRulebookSucceeds(temporary_value);
		else ActRulebookFails(temporary_value);
		return 2;
	} -) - in to only.
To anonymously abide by (RL - value of kind K based rule producing a value) for (V - K)
	(documented at ph_abideanon):
	(- if (temporary_value = FollowRulebook({RL}, {V}, true)) {
		if (RulebookSucceeded()) ActRulebookSucceeds(temporary_value);
		else ActRulebookFails(temporary_value);
		return 2;
	} -) - in to only.
To anonymously abide by (RL - a nothing based rule)
	(documented at ph_abideanon):
	(- if (temporary_value = FollowRulebook({RL})) {
		if (RulebookSucceeded()) ActRulebookSucceeds(temporary_value);
		else ActRulebookFails(temporary_value);
		return 2;
	} -) - in to only.

@ Within the rulebooks to do with an action, returning |true| from a rule
is sufficient to stop the rulebook early: there is no need to specify
success or failure because that is determined by the rulebook itself. (For
instance, if the check taking rules stop for any reason, the action failed;
if the after rules stop, it succeeded.) In some rulebooks, notably "instead"
and "after", the default is to stop, so that execution reaching the end of
the I6 routine for a rule will run into an |rtrue|. "Continue the action"
prevents this.

=
Section 3 - Stop or continue

To stop the action
	(documented at ph_stopaction):
	(- rtrue; -) - in to only.
To continue the action
	(documented at ph_continueaction):
	(- rfalse; -) - in to only.

@ =

	(- (STORED_ACTION_TY_Involves({-by-reference:act}, {X})) -).
To decide what action name is the action name part of (act - a action)
	(documented at ph_actionpart):
	(- (STORED_ACTION_TY_Part({-by-reference:act}, STORA_ACTION_F)) -).

	(documented at ph_actorpart):
	(- (STORED_ACTION_TY_Part({-by-reference:act}, STORA_ACTOR_F)) -).

@h The model world.
Phrase definitions with wordings like "the story has ended" are a
necessary evil. The "has" here is parsed literally, not as the present
tense of "to have", so inflected forms like "the story had ended" are
not available: nor is there any value "the story" for the subject noun
phrase to hold... and so on. Ideally, we would word all conditional phrases
so as to avoid the verbs, but natural language just doesn't work that way.

=
Chapter 4 - The Model World

Section 1 - Ending the story

To end the story
	(documented at ph_end):
	(- deadflag=3; story_complete=false; -).
To end the story finally
	(documented at ph_endfinally):
	(- deadflag=3; story_complete=true; -).
To end the story saying (finale - text)
	(documented at ph_endsaying):
	(- deadflag={-by-reference:finale}; BlkValueIncRefCountPrimitive(deadflag); story_complete=false; -).
To end the story finally saying (finale - text)
	(documented at ph_endfinallysaying):
	(- deadflag={-by-reference:finale}; BlkValueIncRefCountPrimitive(deadflag); story_complete=true; -).

@ Times of day.

=
Section 2 - Times of day

To decide which number is the minutes part of (t - time)
	(documented at ph_minspart):
	(- ({t}%ONE_HOUR) -).
To decide which number is the hours part of (t - time)
	(documented at ph_hourspart):
	(- ({t}/ONE_HOUR) -).

@ Comparing times of day is inherently odd, because the day is
circular. Every 2 PM comes after a 1 PM, but it also comes before
another 1 PM. Where do we draw the meridian on this circle? The legal
day divides at midnight but for other purposes (daylight savings time,
for instance) society often chooses 2 AM as the boundary. Inform uses
4 AM instead as the least probable time through which play continues.
(Modulo a 24-hour clock, adding 20 hours is equivalent to subtracting
4 AM from the current time: hence the use of |20*ONE_HOUR| below.)
Thus 3:59 AM is after 4:00 AM, the former being at the very end of a
day, the latter at the very beginning.

=
To decide if (t - time) is before (t2 - time)
	(documented at ph_timebefore):

To decide which time is (t - time) after (t2 - time)
	(documented at ph_shiftafter):

	(- LIST_OF_TY_Mol({-new:list of objects}) -).

@h Message support.
"Unindexed" here is a euphemism for "undocumented". This is where
experimental or intermediate phrases go: things we don't want people
to use because we will probably revise them heavily in later builds of
Inform. For now, the Standard Rules do make use of these phrases, but
nobody else should. They will change without comment in the change
log.

=
Section SR5/8/1 - Message support - Issuance - Unindexed

To issue score notification message:
	(- NotifyTheScore(); -).
To say pronoun dictionary word:
	(- print (address) pronoun_word; -).
To say recap of command:
	(- PrintCommand(); -).
The pronoun reference object is an object that varies.
The pronoun reference object variable is defined by Inter as "pronoun_obj".

To say pronoun i6 dictionary word:
	(- print (address) pronoun_word; -).

To say parser command so far:
	(- PrintCommand(); -).

@h Deprecated or private-API-like phrases.
None of these are part of Inform's public specification, and they should be
used only by extensions built in to Inform; they may change at any time.

Chapter 6 - Deprecated or private phrases - Unindexed

Section 1 - Spatial modelling - Unindexed

@ These are actually sensible concepts in the world model, and could even
be opened to public use, but they're quite complicated to explain.

=
To decide which object is the component parts core of (X - an object):
	(- CoreOf({X}) -).
To decide which object is the common ancestor of (O - an object) with
	(P - an object):
	 (- (CommonAncestor({O}, {P})) -).
To decide which object is the not-counting-parts holder of (O - an object):
	 (- (CoreOfParentOfCoreOf({O})) -).
To decide which object is the visibility-holder of (O - object):
	(- VisibilityParent({O}) -).
To calculate visibility ceiling at low level:
	(- FindVisibilityLevels(); -).
To decide which object is the touchability ceiling of (O - object):
	(- TouchabilityCeiling({O}) -).

@ These are in effect global variables, but aren't defined as such, to
prevent people using them. Their contents are only very briefly meaningful,
and they would be dangerous friends to know.

=
To decide which number is the visibility ceiling count calculated:
	(- visibility_levels -).
To decide which object is the visibility ceiling calculated:
	(- visibility_ceiling -).

@ This is a unique quasi-action, using the secondary action processing
stage only. A convenience, but also an anomaly, and let's not encourage
its further use.

=
Section 2 - Room descriptions - Unindexed

To produce a room description with going spacing conventions:
	(- LookAfterGoing(); -).

@ An ugly little trick needed because of the mismatch between I6 and I7
property implementation, and because of legacy code from the old I6 library.
Please don't touch.

=
To print the location's description:
	(- PrintOrRun(location, description); -).

@ The following cries out for an enumerated kind of value, but for historical
reasons it isn't one.

=
To decide if set to sometimes abbreviated room descriptions:
	(- (lookmode == 1) -).
To decide if set to unabbreviated room descriptions:
	(- (lookmode == 2) -).
To decide if set to abbreviated room descriptions:
	(- (lookmode == 3) -).

@ Action conversion is a trick used in the Standard Rules to simplify the
implementation of actions: it allows one action to become another one
mid-way, without causing spurious action failures. (There are better ways
to make user-defined actions convert, and some of the examples show this.)

=
Section 3 - Action conversion - Unindexed

To convert to (AN - an action name) on (O - an object):
	(- return GVS_Convert({AN},{O},0); -) - in to only.
To convert to (AN - an action name) on (O - an object) with (T - a snippet):
	(- return GVS_Convert({AN},{O},{T}); -) - in to only.
To convert to request of (X - object) to perform (AN - action name) with
	(Y - object) and (Z - object):
	(- return ConvertToRequest({X}, {AN}, {Y}, {Z}); -).
To convert to special going-with-push action:
	(- return ConvertToGoingWithPush(); -).

@ The "surreptitiously" phrases shouldn't be used except in the Standard Rules
because they temporarily violate invariants for the object tree and the
light variables; the SR uses them carefully in situations where it's known to
work out all right.

=
Section 4 - Surreptitious violation of invariants - Unindexed

To surreptitiously move (something - object) to (something else - object):
	(- move {something} to {something else}; -).
To surreptitiously move (something - object) to (something else - object) during going:
	(- MoveDuringGoing({something}, {something else}); -).
To surreptitiously reckon darkness:
	(- SilentlyConsiderLight(); -).

@ These are text substitutions needed to make the capitalised lists work.

=
Section 5 - Capitalised list-writing - Unindexed

To say list-writer list of marked objects: (-
	 	WriteListOfMarkedObjects(ENGLISH_BIT);
	-).
To say list-writer articled list of marked objects: (-
	 	WriteListOfMarkedObjects(ENGLISH_BIT+DEFART_BIT+CFIRSTART_BIT);
	-).

@ This avoids "mentioned" being given to items printed only internally for
the sake of a string comparison, and not shown on screen.

=
Section 6 - Printing names - Unindexed

To decide if expanding text for comparison purposes:
	(- say__comp -).

@ This is a bit trickier than it looks, because it isn't always set when
one thinks it is. (And since first typing that sentence, I've forgotten
when that would be.)

=
Section 7 - Command parsing - Unindexed

To decide whether the I6 parser is running multiple actions:
	(- (multiflag==1) -).

@ The antique forms "yes" and "no" are now somewhat to be regretted, with
"decide yes" and "decide no" being clearer ways to write the same thing.
But we seem to be stuck with them.

=
Section 8 - Deprecated Inform - unindexed

To yes
	(documented at ph_yes):
	(- rtrue; -) - in to decide if only.
To no
	(documented at ph_no):
	(- rfalse; -) - in to decide if only.

@ This is convenient for debugging Inform, but for no other purpose. It
toggles verbose logging of the type-checker.

=
Section 9 - Debugging Inform - Unindexed

To ***:
	(- {-primitive-definition:verbose-checking} -).
To *** (T - text):
	(- {-primitive-definition:verbose-checking} -).

@ And so, at last...

=
The Standard Rules end here.

@ ...except that this is not quite true, because like most extensions they
then quote some documentation for Inform to weave into index pages: though
here it's more of a polite refusal than a manual, since the entire system
documentation is really the description of what was defined in this
extension.

=
---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Unlike other extensions, the Standard Rules are compulsorily included
with every work of interactive fiction made with Inform. They are described
throughout the documentation supplied with Inform, so no details will be
given here.
