Activities.

The built-in activities and their default stock of rules; and in particular,
the locale description mechanism.

@ These must not be created until the basic rulebooks are in place, because
creating any activity automatically creates three rulebooks as well.

The |srules| template expects the following activities to be created and in
this order. (That is, the order here must exactly match that of the |*_ACT|
constant definitions made in |Definitions.i6t|.) The activities are fairly
completely described in the Inform documentation, so the only notes here
concern implementation.

Part Four - Activities

@h Issuing responses.
Responses are textual replies made by rules, and while one could imagine
uses for them outside of an IF-like dialogue, they belong better in the
Standard Rules (i.e., as an aspect of IF) than in the general-purpose
language. So |STANDARD_RESPONSE_ISSUING_R| is in |srules|, not |basicinform|,
and we define:

=
Section 1 - Responses

Issuing the response text of something -- hidden in RULES command -- -- documented at act_resp -- is an
activity on responses.
The issuing the response text activity is accessible to Inter as "PRINTING_RESPONSE_ACT".

The standard issuing the response text rule is listed last in for issuing the
response text.

The standard issuing the response text rule is defined by Inter as
"STANDARD_RESPONSE_ISSUING_R".

@h Naming and listing.
We start with a piece of unfinished business. The "printing the name"
activity was created by Basic Inform, but we need to add a rule to its
before rule which marks any item whose name is being printed with
the "mentioned" property, for reasons to be found below.

=
Section 2 - Naming and Listing

Before printing the name of a thing (called the item being printed)
	(this is the make named things mentioned rule):
	if expanding text for comparison purposes, continue the activity;
	now the item being printed is mentioned.

Printing a number of something (documented at act_pan) is an activity.
The printing a number activity is accessible to Inter as "PRINTING_A_NUMBER_OF_ACT".

Rule for printing a number of something (called the item) (this is the standard
	printing a number of something rule):
	say "[listing group size in words] ";
	carry out the printing the plural name activity with the item.
The standard printing a number of something rule is listed last in the for printing
a number rulebook.

@ When they occur in room descriptions, names of things are sometimes
supplemented by details:

=
Printing room description details of something (hidden in RULES command) (documented at act_details) is an activity.
The printing room description details activity is accessible to Inter as "PRINTING_ROOM_DESC_DETAILS_ACT".

Printing inventory details of something (hidden in RULES command) (documented at act_idetails) is an activity.
The printing inventory details activity is accessible to Inter as "PRINTING_INVENTORY_DETAILS_ACT".

@ Names of things are often formed up into lists, in which they are sometimes
grouped together:

=
Listing contents of something (hidden in RULES command) (documented at act_lc) is an activity.
The listing contents activity is accessible to Inter as "LISTING_CONTENTS_ACT".
The standard contents listing rule is listed last in the for listing contents rulebook.
The standard contents listing rule is defined by Inter as "STANDARD_CONTENTS_LISTING_R".
Grouping together something (hidden in RULES command) (documented at act_gt) is an activity.
The grouping together activity is accessible to Inter as "GROUPING_TOGETHER_ACT".


@ And such lists of names are formed up in turn into room descriptions.
Something which is visible in a room can either have a paragraph of its own
or can be relegated to the list of "nondescript" items at the end.

=
Writing a paragraph about something (documented at act_wpa) is an activity.
The writing a paragraph about activity is accessible to Inter as "WRITING_A_PARAGRAPH_ABOUT_ACT".

@ When these paragraphs have all gone by, the nondescript items left over are
more briefly listed: the following activity gets the chance to change how
this is done.

=
Listing nondescript items of something (documented at act_lni) is an activity.
The listing nondescript items activity is accessible to Inter as "LISTING_NONDESCRIPT_ITEMS_ACT".

@ Darkness behaves, for room description purposes, a little as if it were a
room in its own right. Until the 1990s that was almost always how darkness
was implemented in IF programs: this persists in I6, but not I7, where the
existence of a room-which-is-not-a-room would break type safety.

=
Printing the name of a dark room (documented at act_darkname) is an activity.
The printing the name of a dark room activity is accessible to Inter as "PRINTING_NAME_OF_DARK_ROOM_ACT".
Printing the description of a dark room (documented at act_darkdesc) is an activity.
The printing the description of a dark room activity is accessible to Inter as "PRINTING_DESC_OF_DARK_ROOM_ACT".
Printing the announcement of darkness (documented at act_nowdark) is an activity.
The printing the announcement of darkness activity is accessible to Inter as "PRINTING_NEWS_OF_DARKNESS_ACT".
Printing the announcement of light (documented at act_nowlight) is an activity.
The printing the announcement of light activity is accessible to Inter as "PRINTING_NEWS_OF_LIGHT_ACT".
Printing a refusal to act in the dark (documented at act_toodark) is an activity.
The printing a refusal to act in the dark activity is accessible to Inter as "REFUSAL_TO_ACT_IN_DARK_ACT".

The look around once light available rule is listed last in for printing the
announcement of light.

This is the look around once light available rule:
	try looking.

@ Two special forms of printing: the status line at the top of the screen,
refreshed every turn during play, and the banner which appears at or close
to the start of play:

=
Constructing the status line (documented at act_csl) is an activity.
The constructing the status line activity is accessible to Inter as "CONSTRUCTING_STATUS_LINE_ACT".
Printing the banner text (documented at act_banner) is an activity.
The printing the banner text activity is accessible to Inter as "PRINTING_BANNER_TEXT_ACT".

@h Parsing activites.
Now a brace of activities to intervene in how the command parser does its
parsing, arranged roughly in chronological order of their typical use
during a single turn of a typed command, its parsing, and final conversion
into an action.

The unusual notation "(future action)" here allows Inform to parse rule
preambles for these activities in a way which would refer to the action which
might, at some point in the future, be generated -- during parsing we don't of
course yet know what that action is, but there is always a current guess at
what it might be.

=
Section 3 - Command parsing

Reading a command (documented at act_reading) is an activity.
The reading a command activity is accessible to Inter as "READING_A_COMMAND_ACT".
Deciding the scope of something (future action) (documented at act_ds) is an activity.
The deciding the scope activity is accessible to Inter as "DECIDING_SCOPE_ACT".
Deciding the concealed possessions of something (documented at act_con) is an activity.
The deciding the concealed possessions activity is accessible to Inter as "DECIDING_CONCEALED_POSSESS_ACT".
Deciding whether all includes something (future action) (documented at act_all)
	is an activity.
The deciding whether all includes activity is accessible to Inter as "DECIDING_WHETHER_ALL_INC_ACT".
The for deciding whether all includes rules have outcomes it does not (failure) and
	it does (success).
Clarifying the parser's choice of something (future action) (documented at act_clarify)
	is an activity.
The clarifying the parser's choice activity is accessible to Inter as "CLARIFYING_PARSERS_CHOICE_ACT".
Asking which do you mean (future action) (documented at act_which) is an activity.
The asking which do you mean activity is accessible to Inter as "ASKING_WHICH_DO_YOU_MEAN_ACT".
Printing a parser error (documented at act_parsererror) is an activity.
The printing a parser error activity is accessible to Inter as "PRINTING_A_PARSER_ERROR_ACT".
Supplying a missing noun (documented at act_smn) is an activity.
The supplying a missing noun activity is accessible to Inter as "SUPPLYING_A_MISSING_NOUN_ACT".
Supplying a missing second noun (documented at act_smn) is an activity.
The supplying a missing second noun activity is accessible to Inter as "SUPPLYING_A_MISSING_SECOND_ACT".
Implicitly taking something (documented at act_implicitly) is an activity.
The implicitly taking activity is accessible to Inter as "IMPLICITLY_TAKING_ACT".

@ Here are the default rules for the behaviour of ALL:

=
Rule for deciding whether all includes scenery while an actor taking or taking off or
	removing (this is the exclude scenery from take all rule): it does not.
Rule for deciding whether all includes people while an actor taking or taking off or
	removing (this is the exclude people from take all rule): it does not.
Rule for deciding whether all includes fixed in place things while an actor taking or
	taking off or removing (this is the exclude fixed in place things from
	take all rule): it does not.
Rule for deciding whether all includes things enclosed by the person reaching
	while an actor taking or taking off (this is the exclude indirect possessions from
	take all rule): it does not.
Rule for deciding whether all includes a person while an actor dropping or throwing
	or inserting or putting (this is the exclude people from drop all rule):
	it does not.

@ The supplying activities are linguistically interesting, for reasons gone
into in the paper "Interactive Fiction, Natural Language and Semantic
Analysis": English verbs do not naturally seem to feature optional nouns.
Indeed, we say "it rained on Tuesday" where "it" refers to nothing at all,
merely because we can't bring ourselves to leave a gap and say just "rained
on Tuesday". A better example here would be "it sounded like rain", because
we do the same to convey the idea of listening ambiently rather than to
any single thing: listening appears to be rare among actions in that it can
equally well take a noun as not. Just as English handles this problem by
supplying a spurious "it" which appears to mean "the world at large",
so Inform handles it by supplying the current location, with the same idea
in mind. And the same applies to the sense of smell, which can be similarly
defocused.

=
Rule for supplying a missing noun while an actor smelling (this is the ambient odour rule):
	now the noun is the touchability ceiling of the player.

Rule for supplying a missing noun while an actor listening (this is the ambient sound rule):
	now the noun is the touchability ceiling of the player.

@ The following rule is something of a dodge to provide a better parser
response to commands like GO or BRETT, GO. (Putting the rule here, and giving
it a name, allows the user to override it and thus accept the idea of vague
going after all.)

=
Rule for supplying a missing noun while an actor going (this is the block vaguely going rule):
	say "You'll have to say which compass direction to go in." (A).

@ Implicit taking is delegated to the I6 template:

=
The standard implicit taking rule is listed last in for implicitly taking.

The standard implicit taking rule is defined by Inter as "STANDARD_IMPLICIT_TAKING_R" with
	"(first taking [the noun])[command clarification break]" (A),
	"([the second noun] first taking [the noun])[command clarification break]" (B).

@h Posthumous activities.
The very last rules of all. The obituary is a rare example of a
sequence of events in the I6 library having been rolled up into an
activity, partly because it's one of the few clear-cut moments where
several unconnected things happen in succession.

=
Section 4 - Posthumous activities

Amusing a victorious player (documented at act_amuse) is an activity.
The amusing a victorious player activity is accessible to Inter as "AMUSING_A_VICTORIOUS_PLAYER_ACT".

Printing the player's obituary (documented at act_obit) is an activity.
The printing the player's obituary activity is accessible to Inter as "PRINTING_PLAYERS_OBITUARY_ACT".
The print obituary headline rule is listed last in for printing the player's obituary.
The print final score rule is listed last in for printing the player's obituary.
The display final status line rule is listed last in for printing the player's obituary.

The print obituary headline rule is defined by Inter as "PRINT_OBITUARY_HEADLINE_R"
	with " You have died " (A),
		" You have won " (B),
		" The End " (C).
The print final score rule is defined by Inter as "PRINT_FINAL_SCORE_R".
The display final status line rule is defined by Inter as "DISPLAY_FINAL_STATUS_LINE_R".

@ There is one last question: the one which usually reads "Would you like to
RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, or QUIT?", but which sometimes provides other
options too. The "ask the final question rule" handles this, and does so
by repeatedly calling the following activity:

=
Handling the final question is an activity.
The handling the final question activity is accessible to Inter as "DEALING_WITH_FINAL_QUESTION_ACT".

@ It follows that this activity must at least sometimes do something dramatic
to the execution state: perform a quit, for instance. Four primitive rules are
available for the drastic things which the activity might wish to do, but
these are not placed in any rulebook: instead they are available for anyone
who wants to call them. (In the default implementation below, we put
references to them into a table.)

=
The immediately restart the VM rule is defined by Inter as "IMMEDIATELY_RESTART_VM_R".
The immediately restore saved game rule is defined by Inter as "IMMEDIATELY_RESTORE_SAVED_R".
The immediately quit rule is defined by Inter as "IMMEDIATELY_QUIT_R".
The immediately undo rule is defined by Inter as "IMMEDIATELY_UNDO_R" with
	"The use of 'undo' is forbidden in this story." (A),
	"You can't 'undo' what hasn't been done!" (B),
	"Your interpreter does not provide 'undo'. Sorry!" (C),
	"'Undo' failed. Sorry!" (D),
	"[bracket]Previous turn undone.[close bracket]" (E),
	"'Undo' capacity exhausted. Sorry!" (F).

@ We structure the activity so that the printing of the question and typing
of the answer take place at the "before" stage, and then the parsing and
acting upon this answer take place at the "for" stage. Reading the keyboard
is the last rule in "before". With the "for" stage, the idea is that any
extra rule slipped in by the user can take precedence over the default
implementation, so the latter is the last there, too.

=
The print the final question rule is listed in before handling the final question.
The print the final prompt rule is listed in before handling the final question.
The read the final answer rule is listed last in before handling the final question.
The standard respond to final question rule is listed last in for handling the final question.

This is the print the final prompt rule: say "> [run paragraph on]" (A).

The read the final answer rule is defined by Inter as "READ_FINAL_ANSWER_R".

@ That clears away the underbrush and reduces us to two matching tasks: (i)
to print the question, (ii) to parse the answer, given that we want to be
able to vary the set of choices available.

We do this by reading the options from the Table of Final Question Options.
(See below for its default contents.) Each row is an option, whose wording
must be placed in the topic column. The final question wording entry can
either be text describing the option -- e.g., "perform a RESTART" -- or
can be left blank, making the option a secret one, omitted from the question
but still recognised as an answer. The only if victorious entry can be set
to make the option available only after a victorious ending, not after a loss;
Infocom's traditional AMUSING option behaved thus. Finally, the table
specifies what to do if the option is taken: either it provides a rule,
or an activity to carry out. (If it provides only an activity, but that
activity is empty, then the option is omitted from the question and not
recognised as an answer.)

=
Section 5 - The Final Question

This is the print the final question rule:
	let named options count be 0;
	repeat through the Table of Final Question Options:
		if the only if victorious entry is false or the story has ended finally:
			if there is a final response rule entry
				or the final response activity entry is not empty:
				if there is a final question wording entry, increase named options count by 1;
	if the named options count is less than 1, abide by the immediately quit rule;
	say "Would you like to " (A);
	repeat through the Table of Final Question Options:
		if the only if victorious entry is false or the story has ended finally:
			if there is a final response rule entry
				or the final response activity entry is not empty:
				if there is a final question wording entry:
					say final question wording entry;
					decrease named options count by 1;
					if the named options count is 1:
						if the serial comma option is active, say ",";
						say " or " (B);
					otherwise if the named options count is 0:
						say "?[line break]";
					otherwise:
						say ", ";

@ And the matching rule to parse and respond to the answer:

=
This is the standard respond to final question rule:
	repeat through the Table of Final Question Options:
		if the only if victorious entry is false or the story has ended finally:
			if there is a final response rule entry
				or the final response activity entry is not empty:
				if the player's command matches the topic entry:
					if there is a final response rule entry, abide by final response rule entry;
					otherwise carry out the final response activity entry activity;
					rule succeeds;
	say "Please give one of the answers above." (A).

@ The table of final options is the only material under the following heading
to make it easier for users to replace with entirely different tables.

These settings are the traditional ones used by Inform since 1995 or so.
The UNDO option has customarily been a "secret", though not much of one,
since it somewhat cheapens the announcement of a calamity to be immediately
offered the chance to reverse it: death, where is thy sting?

@h Locale activities.
A "locale description" is a segment of the text produced by LOOK: the
"locale" is a clutch of objects at a given level in the object tree. Most
room descriptions consist of a top line, a description of the place, and
then a single (though often, as here, multi-paragraph) locale:
= (text)
	Sentier Le Corbusier
	A coastal walk along the rocky shore between Nice and Menton.
	    ...now the locale for the room Sentier Le Corbusier:
	A translucent jellyfish has been washed up by the waves.
	    
	You can also see a bucket and a spade here.
=
A locale typically contains a run of paragraphs specific to interesting
items, especially those not yet picked up, followed by a paragraph which
lists the "nondescript" items -- those not given paragraphs of their own,
such as the bucket and spade. (Some items, though -- typically scenery,
but also for instance the player -- are not even nondescript and do not
appear at all.) A locale can contain no interesting paragraphs, or no list
of nondescript items, or can even contain neither: that is, it can be
entirely empty.

When the player is in or on top of something, multiple locales are described:
= (text)
	Sentier Le Corbusier (in the golf cart)
	A coastal walk along the rocky shore between Nice and Menton.
	    ...now the locale for the room Sentier Le Corbusier:
	A translucent jellyfish has been washed up by the waves.
	    
	You can also see a bucket and a spade here.
	    ...now the locale for the golf cart:
	In the golf cart you can see a map of Villefranche-sur-Mer.
=
To sum up, the text produced by LOOK consists of a header (produced by
the carry out looking rules) followed by one or more locale descriptions
(produced by the activity below).

@h Locale Implementation.
When describing a locale, we keep a Table of interesting objects, each
associated with a priority -- a number indicating how important, and
therefore how near to the top of the description, the object is. A special
syntax allows us to create the Table with exactly the same number of rows
as there are things in the model world: thus, in the worst case where
all things are in a single locale, we still will not run out of table
rows. (We do this rather than creating a large but fixed-size table
because memory is very short in some Z-machine I7 works, so we want to
take only what we might actually need. The table structure is not as
wasteful as it might look: an experiment with using a number property
of things instead showed that this table was actually more efficient,
because of the property numbering overhead in the Z-machine memory
representation of objects.)

=
Section 7 - Locale descriptions - Unindexed

Table of Locale Priorities
notable-object (an object)	locale description priority (a number)
--							--
with blank rows for each thing.

To describe locale for (O - object):
	carry out the printing the locale description activity with O.

To set the/-- locale priority of (O - an object) to (N - a number):
	if O is a thing:
		if N is at most 0, now O is mentioned;
		if there is a notable-object of O in the Table of Locale Priorities:
			choose row with a notable-object of O in the Table of Locale Priorities;
			if N is at most 0, blank out the whole row;
			otherwise now the locale description priority entry is N;
		otherwise:
			if N is greater than 0:
				choose a blank row in the Table of Locale Priorities;
				now the notable-object entry is O;
				now the locale description priority entry is N;

@h Printing the Locale Description.
This is handled by the "printing the locale description" activity. The
before stage works out which objects might be of interest; the for stage
actually prints paragraphs; the after stage is initially empty, but can be
used to insert all kinds of interesting information into a room description.

We count the paragraphs printed in a global variable, not an activity variable,
since it needs to be consulted in sub-activities whose rules are outside what
would be its scope; that doesn't matter, though, since locale descriptions
are not nested. (If they were, the above table would fail in any case.)

(1) Disaster would ensue if the user tampered with the "initialise locale
description rule", but nobody is likely to do this other than intentionally.
(2) The "find notable locale objects rule" in fact only runs a further
activity, the "choosing notable locale objects" activity. The task here
is to identify the objects which might by virtue of their location appear
in the locale, and to assign each of them a priority number.
(3) The "interesting locale paragraphs rule" goes through all of the
notable objects chosen at stage (2), in order of priority, and offers each
to yet another activity: the "printing a locale paragraph about" activity.
This can either print a paragraph related to the item in question, or
demote it as being not even nondescript (by changing its priority to 0).
The default is to do nothing, in which case the item becomes nondescript.
(4) The "you-can-also-see rule" prints what is, ordinarily, the final
paragraph of the locale description, listing the nondescript items. It
goes to some trouble to find out whether these all have a common object tree
parent, listing them with "list contents of" if they do: this is so that
people who have written rules such as "Rule for printing the name of the
blur while listing contents..." will take effect, because the "listing
contents" activity will be going on. Provided that the notable objects
chosen in (2) are all children of the locale domain, this will always
happen. If the user should add rules to make quite different objects also
notable, then the "you-can-also-see rule" has to resort to listing in
a way which doesn't use the "listing contents" activity -- since the
list is not in fact a list of the contents of anything.

=
Printing the locale description of something (documented at act_pld) is an activity.

The printing the locale description activity is accessible to Inter as
"PRINTING_LOCALE_DESCRIPTION_ACT".

The locale paragraph count is a number that varies.

Before printing the locale description (this is the initialise locale description rule):
	now the locale paragraph count is 0;
	repeat through the Table of Locale Priorities:
		blank out the whole row.

Before printing the locale description (this is the find notable locale objects rule):
	let the domain be the parameter-object;
	carry out the choosing notable locale objects activity with the domain;
	continue the activity.

For printing the locale description (this is the interesting locale paragraphs rule):
	let the domain be the parameter-object;
	sort the Table of Locale Priorities in locale description priority order;
	repeat through the Table of Locale Priorities:
		carry out the printing a locale paragraph about activity with the notable-object entry;
	continue the activity.

For printing the locale description (this is the you-can-also-see rule):
	let the domain be the parameter-object;
	let the mentionable count be 0;
	if the domain is a thing and the domain holds the player and the domain is falsely-unoccupied, continue the activity;
	repeat with item running through things:
		now the item is not marked for listing;
	repeat through the Table of Locale Priorities:
		if the locale description priority entry is greater than 0,
			now the notable-object entry is marked for listing;
		increase the mentionable count by 1;
	if the mentionable count is greater than 0:
		repeat with item running through things:
			if the item is mentioned:
				now the item is not marked for listing;
		begin the listing nondescript items activity with the domain;
		if the number of marked for listing things is 0:
			abandon the listing nondescript items activity with the domain;
		otherwise:
			if handling the listing nondescript items activity with the domain:
				if the domain is the location:
					say "[We] " (A);
				otherwise if the domain is a supporter or the domain is an animal:
					say "On [the domain] [we] " (B);
				otherwise:
					say "In [the domain] [we] " (C);
				if the locale paragraph count is greater than 0:
					say "[regarding the player][can] also see " (D);
				otherwise:
					say "[regarding the player][can] see " (E);
				let the common holder be nothing;
				let contents form of list be true;
				repeat with list item running through marked for listing things:
					if the holder of the list item is not the common holder:
						if the common holder is nothing,
							now the common holder is the holder of the list item;
						otherwise now contents form of list is false;
					if the list item is mentioned, now the list item is not marked for listing;
				filter list recursion to unmentioned things;
				if contents form of list is true and the common holder is not nothing,
					list the contents of the common holder, as a sentence, including contents,
						giving brief inventory information, tersely, not listing
						concealed items, listing marked items only;
				otherwise say "[a list of marked for listing things including contents]";
				if the domain is the location, say " [here]" (F);
				say ".[paragraph break]";
				unfilter list recursion;
			end the listing nondescript items activity with the domain;
	continue the activity.

@h Choosing Notable Locale Objects.
By default, the notable objects are exactly the children of the domain, and
they all have equal priority (1). Since table sorting is stable, and thus
preserves the row order of rows with equal priority, the eventual order of
listing is by default the same as the order in which things are added to the
table, which in turn is the object-tree traversal order.

=
Choosing notable locale objects of something (documented at act_cnlo) is an activity.
The choosing notable locale objects activity is accessible to Inter as "CHOOSING_NOTABLE_LOCALE_OBJ_ACT".

For choosing notable locale objects (this is the standard notable locale objects rule):
	let the domain be the parameter-object;
	let the held item be the first thing held by the domain;
	while the held item is a thing:
		set the locale priority of the held item to 5;
		now the held item is the next thing held after the held item;
	continue the activity.

@h Printing a Locale Paragraph.
By default there are four kinds of "interesting" locale paragraph, and
the following setup is fairly complicated because it implements conventions
gradually built up between 1978 and 2008.

To recap, this activity is run on each notable thing in turn, in priority
order. (It is only run on notable things for efficiency reasons.)

The basic principle is that, at every stage, we should consider an item
only if it is not "mentioned" already. This will happen if it has been
named by a previous paragraph, but also if it has been explicitly marked
as such to get rid of it. In considering an item, we have three basic
options:
(a) Print a paragraph about the item and mark it as mentioned -- this
is good for interesting items deserving a paragraph of their own.
(b) Print a paragraph, but do not mark it as mentioned -- this is only
likely to be useful if we want to print information related to the
item without mentioning the thing itself. (For instance, if the presence
of a mysterious parcel resulted in a ticking noise, we could print a
paragraph about the ticking noise without mentioning the parcel, which
would then appear later.)
(c) Mark the item as mentioned but print nothing -- this gets rid of the
item, ensuring that it will not appear in the final "you can also see"
sentence, and will not be considered by subsequent rules.
(d) Do nothing at all -- the item then becomes "nondescript" and appears
in the final "you can also see" sentence, unless somebody else mentions
it in the mean time.

Briefly, then, the following is the standard method:

(1) The "don't mention player's supporter in room descriptions rule"
excludes anything the player is directly or indirectly standing on or,
less frequently, in. The header of the room description has probably
already said something like "Boudoir (on the four-poster bed)", so
the player can't be unaware of this item.
(2) The "don't mention scenery in room descriptions rule" excludes
scenery.
(3) The "don't mention undescribed items in room descriptions rule"
excludes the player object. (It's redundant to say "You can also see
yourself here.") At present nothing else in I7 is "undescribed"
in this sense.
(4) The "set pronouns from items in room descriptions rule" adjusts
the meaning of pronouns like IT and HER to pick up items mentioned.
Thus if a room description ends "Mme Tourmalet glares at you.", then
HER would be adjusted to mean Mme Tourmalet.
(5) The "offer items to writing a paragraph about rule" gives the
"printing a paragraph about" activity a chance to intervene. We detect
whether it does intervene or not by looking to see if it has printed
any text.
(6) The "use initial appearance in room descriptions rule" uses the
initial appearance property of an object which has never been handled
as a paragraph.
(7) The "describe what's on scenery supporters in room descriptions rule"
is a somewhat controversial feature: whereas the rest of Inform's room
description conventions are generally consensus, this one is much
disliked by some users for its occasional inappropriateness. It prints
text such as "On the mantelpiece is a piece of chalk." for items which,
like the mantelpiece, are scenery mentioned (we assume) in the main
room description. (It is assumed that scenery supporters make their contents
more prominently visible than scenery containers, which we do not announce
the contents of.) The ability to modify, replace or abolish this rule was
one of the main motivations to break room description up into activities
in March 2008.
