Miscellaneous Definitions.

A miscellany of properties, variables, rulebooks and activities. Whereas the
Standard Rules for interactive fiction are luxuriant in providing these, the
Basic Inform kernel is as small as it sensibly can be, with just a few of each.

Part Two - Miscellaneous Definitions

An abstract object is a kind of object.

@h Properties.
The following declaration is misleading, since Inform doesn't read it
literally. "Variable initial value" is in fact the only property common
to global variables, a behind-the-scenes convenience. It's not visible
or useful in regular coding, and doesn't belong to objects.

=
An object has a value called variable initial value.

@ Objects do, however, have a wealth of properties to do with their naming.
"Specification" is special: it isn't compiled, but holds text used to
annotate the Kinds index. "Indefinite appearance text" is also an internal
property (it holds the text sometimes given in double-quotes immediately
after an object is created).

=
An object has a text called specification.

The specification of abstract object is "Can be used for objects which are purely
conceptual, like ideas, or are needed for internal book-keeping."

An object has a text called indefinite appearance text.
An object has a text called printed name.
An object has a text called printed plural name.
An object has a text called an indefinite article.
An object can be plural-named or singular-named. An object is usually singular-named.
An object can be proper-named or improper-named. An object is usually improper-named.
An object can be ambiguously plural.

@ These are Inter identifier names.

=
The indefinite article property is defined by Inter as "article".
The printed plural name property is defined by Inter as "plural".
The printed name property is defined by Inter as "short_name".
The plural-named property is defined by Inter as "pluralname".
The ambiguously plural property is defined by Inter as "ambigpluralname".
The proper-named property is defined by Inter as "proper".

@h Variables.
Most of the built-in kinds and kind constructors, such as "number" and
"list of K", are defined in special low-level files read in by Inform early
in its run -- not here. "Natural language" is an exception.

"Language of play" should no longer be taken to imply play; it's really the
natural language of our output text, if any. It affects how verbs conjugate,
and what "say N in words" does, for example.

=
A natural language is a kind of value.
The language of play is a natural language that varies.

@ The "parameter-object" is, as its hyphenated name suggests, an internal
implementation convenience. When a rulebook runs on a given value, it holds
that value. It is really an alias, not a fixed variable, and has whatever
kind is appropriate to the rulebook currently running. (In particular,
despite the definition below, it is not necessarily an object.)

=
The parameter-object is an object that varies.
The parameter-object variable is defined by Inter as "parameter_value".

@h Rulebooks.
The Standard Rules (for interactive fiction) create a wealth of rulebooks
and activities in order to model a fictional world. Here we are much more
sparing: a Basic Inform project begins with a very minimal number of rules.

The startup and shutdown rulebooks and the "starting the virtual machine"
activity perform essential work before a Basic Inform project can begin.

Be wary modifying these: rulebooks and activities must be defined in exactly
the right order, matching definitions both in the Inform 7 compiler and in the
template libraries. (Remember that creating an activity creates three rulebooks.)
(And to define rules listed "first" in the right order, we have to reverse their
order in the source code. Messy.)

These rules here are the ones which get the basic machinery working
to the point where it is safe to run arbitrary I7 source text. They necessarily
do very low-level things, and it is not guaranteed that I7 phrases will behave
to specification if executed before these early rules have finished. So it
is hazardous to obstruct or alter them.

(a) The "virtual machine startup rule" carries out necessary steps to
begin execution on the virtual machine in use: this entails relatively little
on the Z-machine versions 5 or 8, but can involve extensive work to get the
screen display working on Glulx or Z6.

(b) The platform specific startup rule contains code which Inform injects for
the specific compilation platform. Note that this is not the same as an
architecture: both Glulx and C use the 32 bit architecture, but are different
platforms, and so might inject different code into this rule.

(c) The "initialise memory rule" starts up the memory allocation heap,
if there is one, and sets some essential I6 variables. If there is any rule
not to meddle with, this is it.

(d) The "seed random number generator rule" seeds the RNG to a fixed value
if Inform has requested this (which it does in response to the |-rng| command
line switch, which is in turn used by the |intest| testing utility: it's a
way to make deterministic tests of programs which use random values).

(e) The "recover Glk objects rule" runs the object recovery process in order to
identify and pre-existing Glk objects after a restart.

(f) The "open built in windows rule" opens the Glk windows; only after this
point is it safe to print anything.

@h Activities.
However, there are a small number of printing related activities which are also
functional in Basic Inform.
