Phrase Definitions.

The phrases making up the basic Inform language, and in terms of which all
other phrases and rules are defined.

@ All phrases of the Inform language itself are defined here. The Standard
Rules extension adds more, specialised for interactive fiction creation,
but the bones of the language are here. For example, we will define what
the plus sign will mean, and how Inform should compile "say N in words",
where N is a number. Inform has no phrase definitions built in, as such;
but it does contain assumptions about control structures such as "say ...",
"repeat ...", "let ...", "otherwise ..." and so on will behave. Those, we
would not be able to redefine in fundamentally different ways. In most
respects, though, we are more or less free to define any language we like.

At first sight, these phrase definitions look little more than simple
transliterations, and this was one source of early criticism of Inform 7.
Phrases appeared to have very simplistic definitions, with the natural
language simply being a verbose description of obviously equivalent C-like
code. However, the simplicity is misleading, because the definitions below
tend to conceal where the complexity of the translation process suddenly
increases. If the preamble includes "(c - condition)", and the definition
includes the expansion |{c}|, then the text forming c is translated in a way
much more profound than any simple substitution process could describe.
Type-checking also complicates the code produced below, since Inform
automatically generates the code needed to perform run-time type checking at
any point where doubt remains as to the phrase definition which must be used.

@ Many of these phrases have what are called inline definitions, written
using the |(-| and |-)| notation. Non-inline phrases are compiled as
functions, which are then called when they need to be used. For example,
"To say the magic number: say 17." compiles to a function, and when
another phrase includes the instruction "say the magic number", that
instruction compiles a call to this function. But an inline phrase
instead generates Inter instructions to do something directly. (That
something may in fact still be just a function call, but not always.)
The Inter code to be generated is expressed by the contents of the
definition between the |(-| and |-)| markers, and is written in a
marked-up form of Inform 6 notation. This is much more concise and
readable than if the Inter code were written out longhand, but it may
give the misleading impression that Inform inline definitions can only
produce Inform 6 code. That is not so: they produce Inter code, which
can then be translated as needed.

Most of the definitions here also have annotations to positions in the
main Inform documentation: for example, |(documented at phs_s)|. This has
no effect on the code compiled, and is used only when Inform generates
certain problem messages; if the source text misuses the phrase, the problem
can then give a reference to the relevant documentation. |phs_s| is a
typical example of a "documentation token", and is only a label. See the
source of the Inform documentation for how this markup is done.

@ Unit tests for the phrases below have test case names beginning |BIP-|,
which stands for "Basic Inform phrase". In fact, these come in pairs, one for
each virtual machine we customarily generate code to. For example, |BIP-Say|
tests the "say" phrase for the Z-machine target, and |BIP-Say-G| does the same
for the Glulx target. But in the commentary below, test cases will be listed
only once.

It follows that running |intest -from inform7 BIP-%c+| will test all of
these phrases on all platforms, since this regular expression matches all
test case names beginning with "BIP-".

@h Say phrases.
We begin with saying phrases: the very first phrase to exist is the one
printing a single value -- literal text, a number, a time, an object, or
really almost anything, since the vast majority of kinds in Inform are
sayable. There used to be separate definitions for saying text, numbers
and unicode characters here, but they were removed in June 2015 as being
redundant. Though they did no harm, they made some problem messages longer
than necessary by obliging them to cite a longer list of possible readings
of a misread phrase.

The three inline definitions here neatly demonstrate the three sorts of
things which appear inside |(-| and |-)|. The definition for "To say s",
which looks more familiar as the "[s]" text substitution, is straightforwardly
Inform 6 notation. The definition for "To say (something - number) in words"
is I6 notation except for the |{something}| part in braces: this expands
to the value used by the code causing compilation. For example, if the code
to be compiled is "say 17 in words" then |{something}| here would expand to
the constant 17. The definition for "To say (val)" is much more complex than
I6 notation could convey, and so a more complex escape notation is needed,
|{-say:val:K}|, which tells Inform to compile code which will say |val| with
whatever method is appropriate to its kind |K|. For documentation on these
escape notations, see the core Inform source code.

The global variable |say__n| tracks the last number printed. For the "in
words" definition, we need to set it by hand, since Inform doesn't otherwise
realise that number-printing is what we are doing here. For definitions of
functions such as |STextSubstitution|, see the source for |BasicInformKit|,
which is also where |say__n| is defined.

See test case |BIP-Say|.

Chapter 1 - Saying

Section 1 - Saying Values

@ Now some fun with number bases:

	(documented at phs_inbaseindigits):

	(documented at phs_inbaseindigits):

	(documented at phs_inbaseindigits):
	(- PrintInBase({N}, {B}, {M}); -).

	(documented at phs_inunsigneddecimal):
	(- PrintInBase({N}, 10, 1); -).

To say (N - a number) in (M - a number) unsigned decimal digit/digits
	(documented at phs_inunsigneddecimaldigits):
	(- PrintInBase({N}, 10, {M}); -).

@ Objects are the most difficult things to say, because of the elaborate
apparatus for managing their natural-language representations. In particular,
we need to say them with a definite or indefinite article, which can either
be capitalised or not, and as part of that we need to keep track of whether
they are proper nouns; in languages other than English, there are also gender
and case to worry about.

Note that "To say ..." phrases are case sensitive on the first word, so that
"to say a something" and "to say A something" are different.

A curiosity of Inform 6's syntax, arising I think mostly from the need to
save property memory in "Curses" (1993), the work of IF for which Inform 1
had been created, is that it lacks a |print (A) ...| statement. The omission
is made good by using a routine in the template library instead.

See test case |BIP-SayName|.

=
Section 2 - Saying Names

To say a (something - object)
	(documented at phs_a):
	(- print (a) {something}; -).
To say an (something - object)
	(documented at phs_a):
	(- print (a) {something}; -).
To say A (something - object)
	(documented at phs_A):
	(- CIndefArt({something}); -).
To say An (something - object)
	(documented at phs_A):
	(- CIndefArt({something}); -).

	(documented at phs_the):
	(- print (the) {something}; -).
To say The (something - object)
	(documented at phs_The):
	(- print (The) {something}; -).

@ Now some text substitutions which are the equivalent of escape characters.
(In double-quoted I6 text, the notation for a literal quotation mark is a
tilde |~|.) Note the use of the "-- running on" annotation, which tells Inform
that a text substitution should not cause a new-line.

See test case |BIP-SaySpecial|.

	(documented at phs_bracket):
	(- print "["; -).

	(documented at phs_apostrophe):
	(- print "'"; -).

@ For an explanation of the paragraph breaking algorithm, see the template
file "Printing.i6t".

See test case |BIP-SayParagraphing|.

=
Section 4 - Saying Line and Paragraph Breaks

To say line break -- running on
	(documented at phs_linebreak):
	(- new_line; -).
To say no line break -- running on
	(documented at phs_nolinebreak):
	do nothing.
To say conditional paragraph break -- running on
	(documented at phs_condparabreak):
	(- DivideParagraphPoint(); -).
To say paragraph break -- running on
	(documented at phs_parabreak):
	(- DivideParagraphPoint(); new_line; -).
To say run paragraph on -- running on
	(documented at phs_runparaon):
	(- RunParagraphOn(); -).
To decide if a paragraph break is pending
	(documented at ph_breakpending):
	(- (say__p) -).

@ Now for "[if ...]", which expands into a rather assembly-language-like
usage of |jump| statements, I6's form of goto. For instance, the text
"[if the score is 10]It's ten![otherwise]It's not ten, alas." compiles
thus:
= (text as Inform 6)
	if (~~(score == 10)) jump L_Say3;
	    ...
	jump L_SayX2; .L_Say3;
	    ...
	.L_Say4; .L_SayX2;
=
Though labels actually have local namespaces in I6 routines, we use
globally unique labels throughout the whole program: compiling the same
phrase again would involve say labels 5 and 6 and "say exit" label 3.
This example text demonstrates the reason we |jump| about, rather than
making use of |if... else...| and bracing groups of statements: it is legal
in I7 either to conclude with or to omit the "[end if]". (If statements
in I6 compile to jump instructions in any event, and on our virtual
machines there is no speed penalty for branches.) We also need the same
definitions to accommodate what amounts to a switch statement. The trickier
text "[if the score is 10]It's ten![otherwise if the score is 8]It's
eight?[otherwise]It's not ten, alas." comes out as:
= (text as Inform 6)
	if (~~(score == 10)) jump L_Say5;
	    ...
	jump L_SayX3; .L_Say5; if (~~(score == 8)) jump L_Say6;
	    ...
	jump L_SayX3; .L_Say6;
	    ...
	.L_Say7; .L_SayX3;
=
In either form of the construct, control passes into at most one of the
pieces of text. The terminal labels (the two on the final line) are
automatically generated; often -- when there is a simple "otherwise" or
"end if" to conclude the construct -- they are not needed, but labels are
quick to process in I6, are soon discarded from I6's memory when not needed
any more, and compile no code.

We assume in each case that the next say label number to be free is always
the start of the next block, and that the next say exit label number is always
the one at the end of the current construct. This is true because Inform does
not allow "say if" to be nested.

See test case |BIP-SayIf|.

=
Section 5 - Saying If and Otherwise

To say if (c - condition)
	(documented at phs_if): (-
	if (~~({c})) jump {-label:Say};
		-).
To say unless (c - condition)
	(documented at phs_unless): (-
	if ({c}) jump {-label:Say};
		-).
To say otherwise/else if (c - condition)
	(documented at phs_elseif): (-
	jump {-label:SayX}; .{-label:Say}{-counter-up:Say}; if (~~({c})) jump {-label:Say};
		-).
To say otherwise/else unless (c - condition)
	(documented at phs_elseunless): (-
	jump {-label:SayX}; .{-label:Say}{-counter-up:Say}; if ({c}) jump {-label:Say};
		-).
To say otherwise
	(documented at phs_otherwise): (-
	jump {-label:SayX}; .{-label:Say}{-counter-up:Say};
		-).
To say else
	(documented at phs_otherwise): (-
	jump {-label:SayX}; .{-label:Say}{-counter-up:Say};
		-).
To say end if
	(documented at phs_endif): (-
	.{-label:Say}{-counter-up:Say}; .{-label:SayX}{-counter-up:SayX};
		-).
To say end unless
	(documented at phs_endunless): (-
	.{-label:Say}{-counter-up:Say}; .{-label:SayX}{-counter-up:SayX};
		-).

@ The other control structure: the random variations form of saying. This
part of the Inform design was in effect contributed by the community: it
reimplements a form of Jon Ingold's former extension Text Variations, which
itself built on code going back to the days of I6.

The head phrase has one of the most complicated definitions suppled with
Inform, but is actually documented fairly explicitly in the Extensions chapter
of "Writing with Inform", so we won't repeat all that here. Essentially it
uses its own allocated cell of storage in an array to remember a state between
uses, and compiles as a switch statement based on the current state.

See test case |BIP-SayOneOf|.

Section 6 - Saying one of

To say one of -- beginning say_one_of (documented at phs_oneof): (-

	(- {-close-brace} -).

@ Now some visual effects, which may or may not be rendered the way the user
hopes: that's partly up to the virtual machine, unfortunately.

See test case |BIP-SayFonts|, though since |intest| runs on plain text only,
you may need to run this in the Inform application to be convinced.

	(documented at phs_listindef):
	(- LIST_OF_TY_Say({-by-reference:L}, 3); -).

@h Variables.
The "now" phrase can do an extraordinary range of things, and is more or
less a genie granting one wish.

The "whether or not" phrase exists only to convert a condition to a value,
and is needed because I7 does not silently cast from one to the other in
the way that C would.

See test case |BIP-Now|.

=
Chapter 2 - Conditions and Variables

Section 1 - Conditions

To now (cn - condition)
	(documented at ph_now):
	(- {cn} -).
To decide what truth state is whether or not (C - condition)
	(documented at ph_whether):
	(- ({C}) -).

@ Assignment is probably the most difficult thing the type-checker has to
cope with, since "let" has to work when applied to both unknown names (it
creates a new variable) and existing ones (kind of value permitting). There
are also four different ways to create with "let", and two to use
existing variables. Note that the "given by" forms are not strictly
speaking assignments at all; the value placed in |t| is found by solving
the equation |Q|. This does require special typechecking, but of a
different kind to that requested by "(assignment operation)". All of which
makes the "To let" section here only slightly shorter than John Galsworthy's
Forsyte novel of the same name.

See test case |BIP-Let|.

@ It is not explicit in the following definitions that Inform should typecheck
that the values held by these storage objects can be incremented or decremented
(as an object, say, cannot, but a number can): Inform nevertheless contains
code which does this.

@h Arithmetic.
There are nine arithmetic operations, internally numbered 0 upwards, and
given verbal forms below. These are handled unusually in the type-checker
because they need to be more polymorphic than most phrases: Inform uses
dimension-checking to determine the kind of value resulting. (Thus a
height times a number is another height, and so on.)

The totalling code (12) is not structly to do with arithmetic in the same
way, but it's needed to flag the phrase for the Inform typechecker's special
attention.

@h Control structures.
The term "control structure" conjures up the thought of conditionals and loops,
and we'll get to those, but we'll begin with the equivalent of the C language's
|return| statement: ending a function call with some value as an outcome.
Inform calls this "deciding" something, since in Inform programs functions
returning values are usually quite functional: that is, their point is what
value they return, rather than the side-effects of what they did.

Note that returning a value has to invoke the type-checker to ensure that
the return value matches the kind of value expected. This certainly rejects
the phrase if it's used in a definition which isn't meant to be deciding
a value at all, so an "in... only" clause is not needed.

The IF-form of Inform allows the antique syntaxes "yes" and "no" as
synonyms for "decide yes" and "decide no"; these are not present in Basic
Inform, and are defined in the Standard Rules (and only to keep old source
text working).

See test case |BIP-Decide|.

=
Chapter 3 - Control

Section 1 - Deciding Outcomes

To decide yes
	(documented at ph_yes):
	(- rtrue; -) - in to decide if only.
To decide no
	(documented at ph_no):
	(- rfalse; -) - in to decide if only.

To stop (documented at ph_stop):
	(- rtrue; -) - in to only.

To decide on (something - value)
	(documented at ph_decideon):
	(- return {-return-value:something}; -).

@ While "unless" is supposed to be exactly like "if" but with the reversed
sense of the condition, that isn't quite true. For example, there is no
"unless ... then ...": logical it might be, English it is not.

The switch form of "if" is subtly different, and here again "unless" is
not allowed in its place.

As with some other control structures, the definitions here are somewhat
partial, and made up for by direct code in the compiler. (There's a limit to
how much a general syntax for phrases can encode control phrases.)

See test case |BIP-If|.

@ "Do nothing" is a curious feature for a high-level programming language (C,
for example, does not have a NOP function); it entered Inform in the earliest
days, when it was useful mainly when natural language syntax had painted users
into a corner. (In the examples, it used to be used when conditions were
awkward to negate -- if condition, do nothing, otherwise blah blah blah -- but
the creation of "unless" made it possible to remove most of the "do
nothing"s.) It is now hardly ever useful.

=
To do nothing (documented at ph_nothing):
	(- ; -).

@ After all that, the while loop is simplicity itself. Perhaps the presence
of "unless" for "if" argues for a similarly negated form, "until" for
"while", but users haven't yet petitioned for this.

@ The repeat loop looks like a single construction, but isn't, because the

then has a different kind of value accordingly). First, the equivalents of
BASIC's |for| loop and of Inform 6's |objectloop|, respectively:

@ A novel feature of Inform is that there is a default value of any kind: for
example, it is 0 for a number, or the empty text for text. When Inform compiles
a value of a given kind but isn't told what value to compile, it always
chooses the default, which is why the following definition works.

@h Text.
Inform programs swim in a sea of texts, and most of the ways to make text
involve substitutions; so phrases to manipulate text are nice to have, but
are bonuses rather than being the essentials.

As repetitive as the following is, it's much simpler and less prone to
possible namespace trouble if we don't define kinds of value for the different
structural levels of text (character, word, punctuated word, etc.).

@h Data Structures.
Inform provides three main data structures: tables, lists, and relations,
which we will take in that order.

Tables mimic tables of data as seen in books or scientific papers. Note that
changing a table entry is not something defined here as a phrase: the
ever-powerful "now" can do that. But changing something to a non-value --
or "blanking" it -- requires specialist phrases.

See test case |BIP-Tables|.

@ These four are for debugging purposes only, and are used in the same test
case. "Showme the contents of ..." is not a text substitution, for efficiency
reasons: for a large table it could produce a gargantuan output, and in a
story file with memory constraints, one might not want to store that in a
text variable.

@h Lists.
The following are all for adding and removing values to dynamic lists.

@ Searching a list is implemented in a somewhat crude way at present, and the
following syntax may later be replaced with a suitable verb "to be listed
in", so that there's no need to imitate.

=

@ A description is a representation of a set of objects by means of a
predicate (e.g., "open unlocked doors"), and it converts into a list of
current members (in creation order), but there's no reverse process.

=

	(documented at ph_changelength):
	(- LIST_OF_TY_SetLength({-lvalue-by-reference:L}, {N}, 0); -).

@ Easy but useful list operations. Sorting ultimately uses a common sorting
mechanism, in "Sort.i6t", which handles both lists and tables.

See test case |BIP-ListOperations|.

@ Relations are the final data structure given here. In some ways they are
the most fundamental of all, but they're not either set or tested by
procedural phrases -- they lie in the linguistic structure of conditions.
So all we have here are the route-finding phrases:
