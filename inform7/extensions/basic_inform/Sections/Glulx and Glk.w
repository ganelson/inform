Glulx and Glk.

Support for Glulx and Glk interpreter systems.

@ =
Part Four - Glulx and Glk (for Glulx only)

@h Version numbering.

=
Chapter - Version numbers

To decide which number is the major version of (V - version number):
	(- (VERSION_NUMBER_TY_Extract({V}, 0)) -).
To decide which number is the minor version of (V - version number):
	(- (VERSION_NUMBER_TY_Extract({V}, 1)) -).
To decide which number is the patch version of (V - version number):
	(- (VERSION_NUMBER_TY_Extract({V}, 2)) -).

@h Feature testing.
These phrases let us test for various interpreter features.
While most features can use the generic functions, a few need special handling,
and so individual phrases are defined for them.

=
Chapter - Glk and Glulx feature testing

Definition: a glk feature is supported rather than unsupported if I6 routine
	"GlkFeatureTest" says so (it is supported by the interpreter).

To decide what version number is the glk version number/--
	(documented at ph_glkversion):
	(- VERSION_NUMBER_TY_NewFromPacked(Cached_Glk_Gestalts-->gestalt_Version) -).

Definition: a glulx feature is supported rather than unsupported if I6 routine
	"GlulxFeatureTest" says so (it is supported by the interpreter).

To decide what version number is the glulx version number/--:
	(- VERSION_NUMBER_TY_NewFromPacked(Cached_Glulx_Gestalts-->GLULX_GESTALT_GlulxVersion) -).

To decide what version number is the interpreter version number/--:
	(- VERSION_NUMBER_TY_NewFromPacked(Cached_Glulx_Gestalts-->GLULX_GESTALT_TerpVersion) -).

@h Glk windows.
Minimal support for Glk windows. Other extensions may extend the kind.

=
Chapter - Glk windows

A Glk window is a kind of abstract object.
The glk window kind is accessible to Inter as "K_Glk_Window".
The specification of a glk window is "Models the Glk window system."

A glk window has a glk window type called the window type.
The window type property translates into Inter as "glk_window_type".

A glk window has a number called the rock number.
The rock number property translates into Inter as "glk_rock".

A glk window has a number called the glk window handle.
The glk window handle property translates into Inter as "glk_ref".

Definition: a glk window is on-screen rather than off-screen if the glk window handle of it is not 0.

@ Setting window types is quite verbose, so we have some subkinds to make it easier.

@h Hyperlinks.
A simple framework for handling hyperlinks in an interoperable manner.

=

@ And some built-in hyperlink tags:

- A rule hyperlink runs a rule when clicked; that in turn allows you to run any other code you like.
- A keypress hyperlink converts a hyperlink event into a character event, for the specified unicode character.

=

Rule hyperlink is a hyperlink tag.

To say link (R - rule):
	(- MakeTaggedHyperlink((+ rule hyperlink +), {-by-reference:R}, RULE_TY); -).

Hyperlink handling rule for a rule hyperlink (this is the rule hyperlink rule):
	follow hyperlink value as a rule;

Keypress hyperlink is a hyperlink tag.

	(- MakeTaggedHyperlink((+ keypress hyperlink +), {-by-reference:C}, UNICODE_CHARACTER_TY); -).

Hyperlink handling rule for a keypress hyperlink (this is the keypress hyperlink rule):
	process a character event for (hyperlink value as a unicode character) in (window of the current glk event);

@h Suspending input.
These properties and phrases allow the author to suspend and resume input requests.

=
Chapter - Suspending and resuming input

A glk window has a text input status.
The text input status property translates into Inter as "text_input_status".
A glk window can be requesting mouse input.
The requesting mouse input property translates into Inter as "requesting_mouse".

To set the current line input of (w - glk window) to (t - text):
	(- WindowBufferSet({w}, {-by-reference:t}); -).

@h Glk object recovery.
These rules are a low level system for managing Glk references. When a Glulx
game restarts and restores, the current Glk IO state is not reset. All the old
windows, sound channels etc. will be kept as they were, even though the game file
might be expecting a different state. This extension allows Inform 7 game files
to ensure that the IO state is as it should be. It does this in three stages:

(a) The "reset glk references rules" is run. Rules should be added to reset all
Glk references as if none existed.

(b) The "identify glk windows rules" etc. are run. These rulebooks will be run
once for each Glk IO object which currently exists. Objects can be identified
through the current glk object rock number and current glk object reference
number variables.

(c) The "glk object updating rules" is run. Rules should be added to correct the
Glk IO state by, for example, closing windows which shouldn't exist, and opening
windows which should but currently do not.
