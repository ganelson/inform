L is {16, 3, 5, -7, 11, -7, 0, 2}.
L reverses to {2, 0, -7, 11, -7, 5, 3, 16}.
L sorts to {-7, -7, 0, 2, 3, 5, 11, 16}.
L then reverses to {16, 11, 5, 3, 2, 0, -7, -7}.
L then rotates to {-7, 16, 11, 5, 3, 2, 0, -7}.
L then rotates backwards to {16, 11, 5, 3, 2, 0, -7, -7}.
L sorts randomly to {-7, 16, 11, 5, 3, 2, 0, -7}.
L sorts in reverse order to {16, 11, 5, 3, 2, 0, -7, -7}.
"F" = list of fruits: {apple, pear, orange}
F sorts in size order to {orange, pear, apple}.
