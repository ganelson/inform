The lower bound is a number that varies. The upper bound is a number that varies.

To begin:
	now lower bound is 1;
	now upper bound is the number of rows in the Table of Perl Test Cases;
	say "Complete test set.";
	repeat with N running from lower bound to upper bound
	begin;
		run single test N;
	end repeat;
	say "Batch complete."

To debug mode (N - a number): (- TEXT_TY_RE_SetTrace({N}); -).
To decide if a regexp error occurred: (- (((TEXT_TY_RE_Err<0) || (TEXT_TY_RE_Err>=32))) -).

To decide what text is regexp error message: (- (TEXT_TY_RE_Err) -).

To say match (N - number):
	say text matching subexpression N.

To say match start pos (N - number):
	(- if (TEXT_TY_MV_End({N},0) >= 0) print TEXT_TY_MV_End({N},0); -).

To say match end pos (N - number):
	(- if (TEXT_TY_MV_End({N},1) >= 0) print TEXT_TY_MV_End({N},1); -).

To test-compile the regular expression (T - text):
	(- TEXT_TY_RE_CompileTree({-by-reference:T});
	if ((TEXT_TY_RE_Err<0) || (TEXT_TY_RE_Err>=32)) print "Error returned: ", (string) TEXT_TY_RE_Err, "^";
	else TEXT_TY_RE_Err = 0;
	-).

	if N is greater than the number of rows in the Table of Perl Test Cases, stop;
	choose row N in the Table of Perl Test Cases;
	if outcome entry is "c",
		say "test [N]: compiling [pattern entry] should produce error [resultant entry].";
	otherwise
		say "test [N]: compiling [pattern entry] should work.";
	test-compile the regular expression pattern entry.

To say casing of (N - a number):
	if N is 1, say "insensitive";
	otherwise say "sensitive".

To say number of rewinds:
	(- TEXT_TY_RE_PrintNoRewinds(); -).

To run single test (N - a number):
	if N is greater than the number of rows in the Table of Perl Test Cases, stop;
	choose row N in the Table of Perl Test Cases;
