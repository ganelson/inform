To begin:
	let N be 31;
	while N is not 1:
		showme N;
		if N is even:
			now N is N divided by 2;
		otherwise:
			now N is N times 3 plus 1;
	repeat with M running from 1 to 5:
		showme M;
	repeat with C running from orange to indigo:
		showme C;
	repeat with C2 running through colours:
		showme C2;
	repeat with K running through { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 }:
		showme K;
	say "First run.";
	repeat through the Table of Neptune's Moons:
		say "[moon entry] has a surface best described as [surface entry].";
	say "Second run.";
	repeat through the Table of Neptune's Moons in reverse order:
