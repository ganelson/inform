Problem__ PM_LicenceUnquoted
  >--> You wrote 'The licence for this story is Knuth-CTAN' (source text, line 1):
    but should give its value in double-quotes, as in the sentence 'The licence
    for this extension is "CC-BY-4.0".'
Problem__ PM_NoSuchLicence
  >--> You wrote 'The licence for this story is Knuth-CTAN' (source text, line 1):
    but gives a licence unknown to Inform, and must be one of those in the SPDX
    standard catalogue of licence IDs, like '"CC-BY-4.0"'. (See spdx.org.)
Inform 7 has finished.
