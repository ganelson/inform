  >--> In the sentence 'now changed subject is "fish"' (source text, line 5),
    it looks as if you intend 'changed subject is "fish"' to be a condition,
    but though they look the same, because both are written in double quotes,
    text values can't in fact be used as topics, so it's impossible to store
    this piece of text in that location.
