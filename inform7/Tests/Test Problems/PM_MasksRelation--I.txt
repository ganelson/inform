  >--> I don't want you to define a phrase with the wording you've used in in
    'To decide whether (X - testval) is beyond (Y - testval)' (source text, line 7)
    because it could be misunderstood. There is already a definition of what it
    means for something to be 'beyond' something else, so this phrase
    definition would look too much like testing whether 'X is beyond Y'. ('The
    verb to be beyond means the containment relation' (source text, line 5).)
