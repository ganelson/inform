Inform 7 v10.2.0 has started.
I've now read your source text, which is 28 words long.
I've also read version 2 of Basic Inform by Graham Nelson, which is 7938 words long.
I've also read version 2 of English Language by Graham Nelson, which is 2330 words long.
I've also read version 7 of Standard Rules by Graham Nelson, which is 35035 words long.
Problem__ PM_HeadingInPlaceOfUnknown
  >--> In the sentence 'Section of Minimal Grammar (in place of Section SR4/10
    - Mythical Stuff in Standard Rules by Graham Nelson)' (source text, line 3),
    it looks as if you intend to replace a section of source text from the
    extension 'Standard Rules by Graham Nelson', but that extension does not
    seem to have any heading called 'Section SR4/10 - Mythical Stuff'. (The
    version I loaded was 7.)
Inform 7 has finished.
