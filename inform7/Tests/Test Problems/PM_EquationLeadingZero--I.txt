Problem__ PM_EquationLeadingZero
  >--> In 'let F be given by F = 001, where F is a number' (source text, line 4),
    you define an equation 'F = 001': but a number in an equation isn't allowed
    to begin with a '0' digit, so an equation like 'M = 007+Q' is against the
    rules.
    I was trying to match one of these phrases:
    1.  let (f - a new name) be given by (f = 001 , where f is a number - equation
    name) 
    2.  let (f - a temporary named value) be given by (f = 001 , where f is a
    number - equation name) 
    3.  let (f - a new name) be (given by f = 001 , where f is a number - description
    of relations of values) 
    4.  let (f - a new name) be (given by f = 001 , where f is a number - name of
    kind) 
    5.  let (f - a new name) be (given by f = 001 , where f is a number - value)
    
    6.  let (f - a temporary named value) be (given by f = 001 , where f is a
    number - value) 
    I recognised:
    f = 001 , where f is a number = an equation name
    But I didn't recognise 'given by f = 001 , where f is a number'.
    The name 'f' doesn't yet exist.
