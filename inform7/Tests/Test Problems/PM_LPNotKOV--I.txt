  >--> You wrote '16:9 specifies 100' (source text, line 3): but you can only

  >--> You wrote '16:9 specifies 100' (source text, line 3): but you can only
    specify ways to write new kinds of value, as created with sentences like 'A
    weight is a kind of value.', and not the built-in ones like 'number' or
    'time'.
