In Part Three - Variables and Rulebooks, Chapter 1 - Variables, Section 3 -
  Used when ruling on accessibility in the extension Standard Rules by Graham
  Nelson:
  >--> You wrote 'The container in question is an object that varies' (the
    Standard Rules, line 472): but the name supplied for this new variable is a
    piece of text which is not available because it has a rival meaning
    already, as a result of definitions made elsewhere. (Sometimes these are
    indirect: for instance, defining a column in a table called 'question' can
    make a name like 'container in question' suddenly ambiguous and thus
    unsuitable to be a variable name.) If you're getting this Problem message
    in the Standard Rules or some other extension you need to use, then your
    only option is to hunt through your own source text to see what you have
    defined which might cause this clash.

Inform 7 has finished.
