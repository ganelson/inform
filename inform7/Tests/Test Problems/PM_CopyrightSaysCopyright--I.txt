  >--> You wrote 'The copyright for this story is "(c) Emily Short 1983"' (source
    text, line 1): but contains the word 'copyright' or a symbol or
    abbreviation to that effect, which it shouldn't, because Inform adds that
    automatically. So '"Emily Short 2024"' is allowed, but not '"(c) Emily
    Short 2024"'.
Inform 7 has finished.
