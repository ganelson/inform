Problem__ PM_ExtensionLicenceOutsideExtensions
  >--> You wrote 'The copyright for this extension is "Emily Short 2024"' (source
    text, line 1): but tries to set the licence for an extension but the main
    source text, which is not allowed - an extension's licence must be set in
    the extension itself.
Inform 7 has finished.
