  >--> This project places two words 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzzz' and
    'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' into the dictionary used for reading player
    commands. But because they differ only after 14 characters, which is the
    current setting for 'Use dictionary resolution', this might cause
    confusion.

  The 11-word source text has successfully been translated. There were 1 room
    and 3 things.
Inform 7 has finished.
