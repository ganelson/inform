To decide which time is the time since (D - a description of scenes) began:
	let max T be 0 minutes;
	repeat with Scn running through D:
		let T be the time since Scn began;
		if T > max T, now max T is T;
	decide on max T.

Definition: a scene is new if it is happening and it is not the Entire Game.  

Stage is a room.

Concert is a scene. Concert begins when play begins.

Every turn when the time since a new scene began is greater than 5 minutes (this is the cure slow pacing issue rule): 
	say "Get a move on."

Space is a room.

Test me with "z / z / z / z / z / z / z / z".
