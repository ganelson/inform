Stage is a room.

Understand "wait for [a time period]" as waiting for. Waiting for is an
action applying to one time.

Understand "wait until [a time]" as waiting until. Waiting until is an
action applying to one time.

Carry out waiting for:
       increase the time of day by the time understood;
       say "You wait around until [the time of day].";
       follow the turn sequence rules;
       try looking.

Carry out waiting until:
       now the time of day is the time understood;
       say "You wait around until [the time of day].";
       follow the turn sequence rules;
       try looking.

Every turn: say "The time is now [the time of day]."

Test me with "wait for 4 hours / wait for 6 minutes / wait for half an hour /
wait until 4 PM / wait for 1 hour 15 minutes / wait for quarter of an hour".
