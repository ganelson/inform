"Chapter 6: Return of the Fussy Table" by Emily Short.

Chapter 6

Use command line echoing. Use scoring.

The Kitchen is a room. "A quiet homelike room heated by a ferocious Aga."

The Dining Room is north of the Kitchen. "A room of handsome proportions, with an octagonal dining table on a fine parquet floor. The original set of chairs has been taken away, leaving only a red velvet dining chair and a blue suede armchair."

The fussy table is a supporter in the Dining Room. It is scenery.

The description is "It's hypochondriac: the result of a sojourn in a superior antique shop, where it picked up the scent of almond oil, words like provenance, and a secretive shame about being resurfaced.

Chairs don't get along with it.

In its mellowest moods, after a really good dusting, it will mention, casually, a cabinet it once knew, which was twelve feet tall, came from the Winter Palace, and had an asking price of $350K."

A chair is a kind of supporter with carrying capacity 1. A chair is enterable.

After entering a chair when the player is wearing a spiky thing (called the clog):
	say "You sit on [the noun], lifting [the list of spiky things worn by the player] so that the parquet is no longer affronted."

The blue suede armchair and the red velvet dining chair are chairs in the Dining Room. The description of the blue suede is "Quiet, mellow, and with a lingering aroma of clove cigarettes, and possibly something less legal. It doesn't sit up straight, and doesn't let anyone else do so either." The red velvet has the description "In temperament, in bearing, in everything it is the opposite of the blue suede chair. It is concerned for its duty all the time, has a rigidly straight back, and pokes diners in the spine when it suspects them of overdoing things. 

Once, in the middle of a luncheon, it groaned audibly when the doctor's wife took a second piece of cake; but the slice was already on her plate, poor dear, and she couldn't put it back, however mortified she might be."

The carrying capacity of the player is 2. 

Section 3 - Sources of adjectives

A thing can be drippy or dry.

Before printing the name of a drippy thing: say "drippy ".

Before printing the name of a cold thing: say "cold ".

Before printing the name of a scalding thing: say "scalding ".

Heat is a kind of value. The heats are luke-warm, cold, and scalding. Everything has a heat. 

The platter is a scalding portable supporter. It is carried by Alison. It has carrying capacity 1.

The glass of ice water is a cold, drippy thing. It is on the table.

A thing can be spiky or smooth. The cleated left shoe is a wearable spiky thing. It is worn by the player. The cleated right shoe is a wearable spiky thing. It is worn.

Instead of examining a drippy thing:
	say "Pretty drippy.".
	
The ceramic tile is a cold portable supporter in the Dining Room. It has carrying capacity 1.

After putting a cold thing on a scalding thing:
	say "[The noun] meets [the second noun]; both shriek in pain. But the necessary heat transfer occurs.";
	now the heat of the noun is luke-warm;
	now the heat of the second noun is luke-warm.
	
After putting a scalding thing on a cold thing:
	say "[The noun] meets [the second noun]; both shriek in pain. But the necessary heat transfer occurs.";
	now the heat of the noun is luke-warm;
	now the heat of the second noun is luke-warm.

Section 4 - Defining new adjectives

Definition: the table is concerned if something drippy is on it or something scalding is on it or something spiky is on it.

Definition: the ceramic tile is concerned if something spiky is on it.

Definition: a room is concerned if something drippy is in it or something scalding is in it or something spiky is in it or someone which is in it is wearing a spiky thing.

Section 5 - Which and who

An every turn rule:
	if something (called the offending item) on the table is drippy,

	if something (called the offending item) on the red chair is drippy,
		say "'Oh dear,' murmurs the red chair, as [the offending item] drips into its velvety seat. 'Oh dear, I will have a damp spot. This is so very -- what will people think?'";
	if something (called the offending item) on the visible armchair is drippy,
		say "[The offending item] visibly begins degrading the suede where it sits. The armchair is tactfully silent.";
	if a drippy thing (called the offending item) is in the location and the player is in the Dining Room,

		say "The armchair doesn't complain about [the offending item]; it just begins, quietly, to give off warm sweet clouds of blue steam, as though its inner opium-nature had been released.";
	if something (called the offending item) in the Dining Room is scalding,
		say "'Yes indeed,' [if the location is the Dining Room]says[otherwise]bellows[end if] the parquet. 'That [offending item] won't leave any sort of mark what-so-ever.'"

An every turn rule when the player is in the dining room:
	if something (called the offending item) on the table is spiky,

Section 7 - Adjacent rooms

Instead of going to an adjacent room when the player is in the Dining Room:
	say "'You're not leaving!?' whimpers the table at once."

Alison is a woman in the Kitchen. The kettle is a scalding thing carried by Alison. 

The Attic is above the Kitchen. The sinister door is north of the Attic and south of the Garret. The sinister door is a door. It is openable, lockable and locked. The player carries a skeleton key. The skeleton key unlocks the sinister door.

The Living Room is west of the Dining Room and northwest of the Kitchen.

The dachsund puppy is an animal in the Attic. Understand "Oscar" as the dachsund.

Every turn when the puppy is not in the location:
	let space be the holder of the puppy;
	let the best direction be the best route from space to the location, using doors;
	if the best direction is not a direction
	begin;
		say "You can hear the puppy whining pathetically in the distance.";
	otherwise;
		let next step be the room the best direction from space;
		move puppy to the next step;
		if the puppy is visible, say "Your puppy bounds joyously into the room, coming [best direction] from [the space]!";
	end if.
	
The Spirit of Furniture Past is a man in the Garret. 

Every turn when the Spirit is not in the location:
	let space be the holder of the Spirit;
	let the best direction be the best route from space to the location, using even locked doors;
	if the best direction is not a direction
	begin;
		say "Something wails spookily in the distance.";
	otherwise;
		let x be the number of moves from the location to the space;
		if x is -1, say "The house shudders ominously as something passes through the walls.";
		let next step be the room the best direction from space;
		move Spirit to the next step;
		if the Spirit is visible
		begin;
			say "The Spirit of Furniture Past drifts [best direction] into the room from [the space] to haunt you.";
		otherwise;
			let x be the number of moves from the next step to the location;
			if x > 0,
				say "Something moans [x in words] room[s] away.";
		end if;
	end if.
	
Understand "teleport to [any room]" as teleporting to.
