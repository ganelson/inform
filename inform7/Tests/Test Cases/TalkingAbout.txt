Philosophy and haute cuisine are concepts.

Laboratory is a room. Liza is a person in the Laboratory. A gong is in the Laboratory.

Instead of attacking the gong:
	say "Bong! This seems to summon Liza's attention to the deep issues.";
	try Liza talking about philosophy.

First carry out an actor talking about an object (called T):
	if the leading beats is not empty:
		let N be the number of entries in the leading beats;
		if N is 1:
			perform entry 1 of the leading beats;
		if N is greater than 1:
			say "Choose...";
			say "[conditional paragraph break]";
			let X be 0;
			repeat with B running through the leading beats:
				increase X by 1;
				say "([X]). [textual content of opening line of B][line break]";
			say "[conditional paragraph break]";
			let Y be a number chosen by the player from 1 to N;
			perform entry Y of the leading beats;
		stop the action;
	if the other beats is not empty:
		let N be the number of entries in the other beats;
		let R be a random number from 1 to N;
		perform entry R of the other beats;
		stop the action;
	if the player is the actor:
		say "There is no reply.";
	otherwise:
		say "[The actor] [talk] about [T].";
	stop the action.
