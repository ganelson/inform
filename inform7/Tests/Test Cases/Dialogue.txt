Test: Dialogue
For: Z-Machine

Use command line echoing.

Laboratory is a room.

Alice, Belle and Camilla are women in the Laboratory.

East of the Laboratory is the Annexe. Diego and Eric are men in the Annexe. The Annexe is dark.

South of the Laboratory is the Garden. Some stumps, the bat and the ball are in the Garden.
Fiona is a woman in the Garden.

West of the Laboratory is the Experimental Zone. Gharlane and Helmuth are men
in the Zone.

North of the Zone is the Strongroom. In the Strongroom are a diamond, an emerald
and a ruby.

When play begins:
	showme audibility relation;
	showme visibility relation;
	showme the list of people who can see Alice;
	showme the list of people who can hear Alice;
	showme the list of people who can see Diego;
	showme the list of people who can hear Diego;
	showme the list of dialogue choices in the nested decisions beat;
	showme the list of dialogue lines in the test only present speakers beat;
	showme the going active scene;
	showme the going active beat;	

Instead of jumping:
	if dialogue about Alice intervenes:
		stop the action.

Instead of listening:
	showme the list of people who can hear the player;
	showme the list of people who can be heard by the player;

After going south to the Garden:
	make the dialogue director active;
	clear conversational subjects;
	perform the going active beat.

After going north from the Garden:
	make the dialog director passive;
	perform the going inactive beat.

Before examining something (called the objet d'art) in the Garden:
	make the objet d'art a live conversational subject.

Every turn when the player is in the Garden or the player is in the Lake:
	showme the live conversational subject list.

The Lake is east of the Garden. The sea monster and the mermaid are in the Lake.

Every turn when the player is in the Garden:
	showme whether or not the bails beat is available;
	showme whether or not the bails beat is relevant.

After going to the Lake:
	alter the live conversational subject list to { sea monster, mermaid }.

To say report on (D - a dialogue beat):
	say "Report on completion of [D].";
	repeat with L running through dialogue lines in D:
		say "[L] is [if L is unperformed]un[end if]performed; [if L is non-recurring]non-[end if]recurring; [if L is unnarrated]un[end if]narrated; [if L is unelaborated]un[end if]elaborated; [if L is unavailable]un[end if]available; [if L is non-verbal]non-[end if]verbal.";
	repeat with C running through dialogue choices in D:
		say "[C] is [if C is unperformed]un[end if]performed; [if C is non-recurring]non-[end if]recurring; [if C is flowing]flowing[otherwise]offered[end if][if C is story-ending]; story-ending[end if].";

Before performing the one-time line:
	say "**** ";

For performing the one-time line:
	say "[speaker] languidly (well, in a [style] way) says: '[textual content of the one-time line]'.";

After performing the one-time line:
	say "(Which I think is only to be expected.)";

Before offering a list of dialogue choices (called L):
	say "(Okay, select from [L] here.)"

First rule for offering a list of dialogue choices (called L):
	let N be 0;
	repeat with C running through L:
		increase N by 1;
		say "(Option [N]) [textual content of C][line break]";
	say conditional paragraph break;
	let M be a number chosen by the player from 1 to N;
	set the dialogue selection value to M;
	say "[bold type][textual content of entry M of L][roman type][paragraph break]".

Spoken angrily and spoken softly are performance styles.

After going to the Zone:
	perform the Boskone beat.

After going to the Strongroom:
	perform the jewellery beat.
