Lab is a room. It contains a box. The box contains a newspaper. The wallchart is scenery in the Lab.

Instead of examining something:
	say relations for the noun. 
	
To say relations for (item - a thing):
	describe the containment relation for item;
	showme the meaning of the verb contain;
	showme the containment relation;

To describe (R - a relation of objects) for (item - a thing):
	say "[item]: [the list of things to which item relates by R with indefinite articles].";
	if a thing to which item relates by R is a thing: 
		say "[The item] [verb rendering applied to a random verb that means R] [the list of things to which item relates by R with indefinite articles]. [run paragraph on]"

To decide which text is the rendering of (V - verb) (this is verb rendering):
	decide on "[adapt V]".  

Test me with "x box / x newspaper".
