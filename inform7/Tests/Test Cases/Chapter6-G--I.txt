Dining Room
A room of handsome proportions, with an octagonal dining table on a fine parquet floor. The original set of chairs has been taken away, leaving only a red velvet dining chair and a blue suede armchair.

On the fussy table is a drippy cold glass of ice water.

You can also see a blue suede armchair, a red velvet dining chair and a cold ceramic tile here.

Your puppy bounds joyously into the room, coming north from the Kitchen!

The Spirit of Furniture Past drifts north into the room from the Kitchen to haunt you.

The parquet floor mutters about the things people wear to walk on parquet floors these days.

"Help! Get me a coaster!" screams the table, its veneer squirming under the drippy cold glass of ice water.

The table looks jealously at the blue suede armchair. "Some people have such an easy life."

Alison hollers, "Perhaps I should put something on this scalding platter."

You can hear Alison moving around in the Kitchen.

The fussy table seems especially worried just now.

The cleated left shoe growls at the velvet chair, which winces and whimpers.

Humming to herself, Alison brings in a hot platter and sets it down smack on the red velvet dining chair, then goes back out.
