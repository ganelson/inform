Version 1 of Vectors by Graham Nelson begins here.

To decide which vector is vector x (X - number) y (Y - number) z (Z - number):
	(- (VECTOR_TY_Fill({-new: vector}, {X}, {Y}, {Z})) -).

To decide which vector of K is vector x (X - value of kind K) y (Y - K) z (Z - K):
	(- (VECTOR_OF_TY_Fill({-new: vector of K}, {X}, {Y}, {Z})) -).

A vector times a vector specifies a vector.

Vectors ends here.
