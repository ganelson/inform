[CSIInline::] Compile Invocations Inline.

Here we generate Inter code to invoke a phrase from its inline definition.

@h Introduction.
In "CSI: Inline", which premieres Thursday at 9, Jack "The Invoker" Flathead,
lonely but brilliant scene of crime officer, tells it like it is, and as serial
killers stalk the troubled streets of Inline, Missouri, ... Well, no: CSI
stands here for "compile single invocation", and this is the harder case where
the phrase being invoked has an inline definition.

Inline definitions vary considerably in both simplicity and their legibility
to human eyes. Here is the text substitution "[bold type]":
= (text)
To say bold type -- running on:
	(- style bold; -).
=
On the other hand, here is how to repeat through a table:
= (text)
To repeat through (T - table name) in (TC - table column) order begin -- end loop
	(-
		@push {-my:ct_0}; @push {-my:ct_1};
		for ({-my:1}={T}, {-my:2}=TableNextRow({-my:1}, {TC}, 0, 1), ct_0={-my:1}, ct_1={-my:2}:
			{-my:2}~=0:
			{-my:2}=TableNextRow({-my:1}, {TC}, {-my:2}, 1), ct_0={-my:1}, ct_1={-my:2})
				{-block}
		@pull {-my:ct_1}; @pull {-my:ct_0};
	-).
=
Inline definitions are written in a highly annotated and marked-up version of
Inform 6 notation, but are not actually I6 code.

That second example is a case where the definition has a "back" as well as a
"front". All definitions have a front; only if the text contains a |{-block}|
marker is there a back as well. The front is the material up to the marker, the
back is the material after it. The idea, of course, is that for inline
definitions of control structures involving blocks of code, we compile the
front material before compiling the block, and the back material afterwards.

@ The process of compiling from an inline definition is a little like
interpreting a program, and a //csi_state// object represents the state of
the (imaginary) computer doing that.

=
typedef struct csi_state {
	struct source_location *where_from;
	struct value_holster VH;
	struct id_body *idb;
	struct parse_node *inv;
	struct tokens_packet *tokens;
	struct local_variable *my_vars[10]; /* the "my" variables 0 to 9 */
} csi_state;

@h Front and back.
The function //CSIInline::csi_inline// compiles from the front of the definition, but not
the back (if it has one). The back won't appear until much later on, when the
new code block finishes. We won't live to see it; in this function, all we do
is pass the tailpiece to the code block handler, to be spliced in later on.

Note that if there is a code block, then any "my" variables created in this
invocation are preserved -- the back part of the definition may want to use
them. They will disappear anyway in that event, because their scope is set to
the code block in question.

=
int CSIInline::csi_inline(value_holster *VH, parse_node *inv, source_location *where_from,
	tokens_packet *tokens) {
	if (VH->vhmode_wanted == INTER_VAL_VHMODE) VH->vhmode_provided = INTER_VAL_VHMODE;
	else VH->vhmode_provided = INTER_VOID_VHMODE;
	csi_state CSIS;
	id_body *idb = Node::get_phrase_invoked(inv);
	@<Initialise the CSI state@>;
	@<Create any new local variables explicitly called for@>;
	CSIInline::from_schema(idb->head_of_defn->at,
		CompileImperativeDefn::get_front_schema(idb), &CSIS);
	if (IDTypeData::block_follows(idb)) {
		if (CodeBlocks::attach_back_schema(
			CompileImperativeDefn::get_back_schema(idb), CSIS) == FALSE) {
			StandardProblems::sentence_problem(Task::syntax_tree(),
				_p_(PM_LoopWithoutBody),
				"there doesn't seem to be any body to this phrase",
				"in the way that a 'repeat', 'if' or 'while' is expected to have.");
		}
	} else {
		@<Release any my-variables created inline@>;
	}
	return idb->compilation_data.inline_mor;
}

@ The 10 variable registers hold the identities of local variables created inside
the inline definition using |{-my:0}| to |{-my:9}|: they're |NULL| until used, and
are mostly not used. The "repeat" example above uses |{-my:1}|, |{-my:2}|, and
|{-my:3}|, but leaves the others null. Most definitions use none of them.

@<Initialise the CSI state@> =
	CSIS.where_from = where_from;
	CSIS.VH = *VH; /* copied because it might be on the C call stack */
	CSIS.idb = idb;
	CSIS.inv = inv;
	CSIS.tokens = tokens;
	for (int i=0; i<10; i++) CSIS.my_vars[i] = NULL;

@ But phrases can create local variables through notation in the prototype as
well as in the definition. Consider the prototype:
= (text)
To repeat with (loopvar - nonexisting object variable)
	running through (L - list of values) begin -- end loop:
	...
=
Here, token 0, "nonexisting object variable", calls for us to create a new
local variable of kind "object" each time the phrase is invoked. This variable
may have a short lifetime, since its scope will be tied to the block of code
about to open.

Note that we do not initialise the variable -- that would be inefficient, in that
such stores would be unnecessary in some cases. So the responsibility of ensuring
that the variable contains a typesafe value is placed on the inline definition.
If it abuses that responsibility, type safety is simply lost. Consider:
= (text)
To conjure (bus - nonexisting object variable):
	(- {bus} = 26201; -).
When play begins:
	conjure the magic bus;
	showme the magic bus.
=
This will end horribly unless 26201 happens to be a valid object number, and it
almost certainly is not. But the Inform compiler throws no problem message, because
the code is legal. See the discussion of |{-initialise:...}| for how to deal with
this issue.

@<Create any new local variables explicitly called for@> =
	for (int i=0; i<Invocations::get_no_tokens(inv); i++) {
		parse_node *val = tokens->token_vals[i];
		kind *K = Invocations::get_token_variable_kind(inv, i);
		if (K) {
			if (K->construct == CON_INTERMEDIATE) {
				StandardProblems::sentence_problem(Task::syntax_tree(),
					_p_(PM_DimensionallyImpossibleLetVariable),
					"this variable does not have a kind I can use",
					"since it results from performing arithmetic on other values "
					"in a way which doesn't result in a kind that I recognise.");
				K = K_number;
			}
			local_variable *lvar = LocalVariables::new_let_value(Node::get_text(val), K);
			if (IDTypeData::block_follows(idb) == LOOP_BODY_BLOCK_FOLLOWS)
				CodeBlocks::set_scope_to_block_about_to_open(lvar);
			else
				CodeBlocks::set_scope_to_current_block(lvar);
			tokens->token_vals[i] =
				Lvalues::new_LOCAL_VARIABLE(Node::get_text(val), lvar);
			if (Kinds::Behaviour::uses_block_values(K)) {
				inter_symbol *lvar_s = LocalVariables::declare(lvar);
				EmitCode::inv(STORE_BIP);
				EmitCode::down();
					EmitCode::ref_symbol(K_value, lvar_s);
					Frames::emit_new_local_value(K);
				EmitCode::up();
			}
		}
	}

@ As we will see (in the discussion of |{-my:...}| below), any variables made
as scratch values for the invocation are deallocated as soon as we're finished,
unless a code block is opened: if it is, then they're deallocated when it ends.

@<Release any my-variables created inline@> =
	for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
		if (CSIS.my_vars[i])
			LocalVariableSlates::deallocate_I7_local(CSIS.my_vars[i]);

@ And this is what happens when the back part of the definition is finally
compiled.

=
void CSIInline::csi_inline_back(inter_schema *back, csi_state *CSIS) {
	if (back) CSIInline::from_schema(current_sentence, back, CSIS);
}

@h Single schemas.
We can now forget about fronts and backs, and work on expanding a single
inline definition into a single stream.

We do this by calling the very powerful |EmitInterSchemas::emit| function,
which parses the schema and calls us back to do something at each point in it.
In particular, it calls //CSIInline::from_schema_token// on each "token" of
the schema, and calls //CSIInline::from_source_text// on any material enclosed
in |(+ ... +)| notation.

|CSIS| is passed to this function as our "opaque state" -- meaning that it is
passed through unchanged to our callback functions, and means that the code
below can share some private state variables.

=
void CSIInline::from_schema(parse_node *from, inter_schema *sch, csi_state *CSIS) {
	if (LinkedLists::len(sch->parsing_errors) == 0) {
		EmitInterSchemas::emit(Emit::tree(), &(CSIS->VH), sch,
			IdentifierFinders::common_names_only(),
			&CSIInline::from_schema_token, &CSIInline::from_source_text, CSIS);
		CompileImperativeDefn::issue_schema_errors(from, sch, NULL);
	}
}

@ So we now have to write the function compiling code to implement |ist|.
See //building: Inter Schemas// for a specification of Inter schema tokens,
but roughly speaking each is either a command or a "bracing".

=
void CSIInline::from_schema_token(value_holster *VH,
	inter_schema_token *ist, void *CSIS_s, int prim_cat, text_stream *arg_L) {
	csi_state *CSIS = (csi_state *) CSIS_s; /* recover the "opaque state" */

	id_body *idb = CSIS->idb;
	parse_node *inv = CSIS->inv;
	tokens_packet *tokens = CSIS->tokens;
	local_variable **my_vars = CSIS->my_vars;

	int C = ist->inline_command;
	if (C != no_ISINC) {
		if (C == primitive_definition_ISINC) @<Expand an entirely internal-made definition@>;
		@<Expand a bracing containing a kind command@>;
		@<Expand a bracing containing a typographic command@>;
		@<Expand a bracing containing a label or counter command@>;
		@<Expand a bracing containing a high-level command@>;

	}

}

@h Bracings for tokens.
For example, if the phrase prototype is |print (something to say - text)|, then the
bracing |{something to say}| refers to the token value at that point.

Such tokens can also be "annotated" with commands. |{-by-reference:something to say}|
means the same but indicates that it should be compiled without copying.

Lastly, though this is much less common, the bracing can compile to the bitmap value
for a phrase option or for the current bitmap of options specified by the invocation.
Those have no annotations.

The natural language part must match this:

@d OPTS_INSUB -1
@d LOCAL_INSUB -2

=
<inline-bracing-source-text> ::=
	phrase options |                      ==> { OPTS_INSUB, - }
	<phrase-option>	|                     ==> { R[1], - }
	<name-local-to-inline-stack-frame> |  ==> { LOCAL_INSUB, RP[1] }
	...                                   ==> @<Issue PM_BadInlineExpansion problem@>

@ This matches one of the token names in the preamble to the inline definition.

=
<name-local-to-inline-stack-frame> internal {
	local_variable *lvar =
		LocalVariables::parse(&(idb_being_parsed->compilation_data.id_stack_frame), W);
	if (lvar) {
		==> { -, lvar };
		return TRUE;
	}
	==> { fail nonterminal };
}

@ In my first draft of Inform, this problem message made reference to "meddling
charlatans" and what they "deserve". I'm a better person now.

	idb_being_parsed = idb;

@ This affects only block values. When it's used, the token accepts the pointer
to the block value directly, that is, not copying the data over to a fresh
copy and using that instead. This means a definition like:
= (text as Inform 7)
To zap (L - a list of numbers):
	(- Zap({-by-reference:L}, 10); -).

this list, the original will change.

@ This is a variant which checks that the reference is to an lvalue, that is,

would behave pretty oddly at run-time.

@ This is used only for compiling down to the |box| statement in I6, which has

@ Suppose we are invoking "decide on 102" from the Basic Inform inline definition
of "decide on ...", which is:

	(- return {-return-value:something}; -)
=
We clearly need to police this: if the phrase is deciding a number, we need to
object to |decide on "fish fingers"|.

That's one purpose of this annotation: it checks the value to see if it's suitable
to be returned. But we also might have to cast the value, or check that it's valid
at run-time. For instance, in a phrase to decide a container, given |decide on the item|
we may need to check "item" at run-time: at compile-time we know it's an object,
but not necessarily that it's a container.

@h Commands about kinds.
And that's it for the general machinery, but in another sense we're only just
getting started. We now go through all of the special syntaxes which make
invocation-language so baroque.

We'll start with a suite of details about kinds:

	{-command:kind name}

@ The following produces a new value of the given kind. If it's stored as a
word value, this will just be the default value, so |{-new:time}| will output
540, that being the Inform 6 representation of 9:00 AM. If it's a block value,
we compile code which creates a new value stored on the heap. This comes into
its own when kind variables are in play.

@h Typographic commands.
These rather clumsy commands are a residue from earlier forms of the markup
language, really. |{-open-brace}| and |{-close-brace}| are handled for us
elsewhere, so we need do nothing. The other two have actually been withdrawn.

@h Label or counter commands.
Here we want to generate unique numbers, or uniquely named labels, on demand.

@<Expand a bracing containing a label or counter command@> =
	if (C == label_ISINC)               @<Inline command "label"@>;
	if (C == counter_ISINC)             @<Inline command "counter"@>;
	if (C == counter_storage_ISINC)     @<Inline command "counter-storage"@>;
	if (C == counter_up_ISINC)          @<Inline command "counter-up"@>;
	if (C == counter_down_ISINC)        @<Inline command "counter-down"@>;
	if (C == counter_makes_array_ISINC) @<Inline command "counter-makes-array"@>;

@ We can have any number of sets of labels, each with its own base name,
which should be supplied as the argument. For example:
= (text)
	{-label:pineapple}
=
generates the current label in the "pineapple" set. (Sets don't need to be
declared: they can be mentioned the first time they are used.) These label
names take the form |L_pineapple_0|, |L_pineapple_1|, and so on; each named
set has its own counter (0, 1, 2, ...). So this inline definition works
safely:
= (text)
	jump {-label:leap}; print "Yikes! A trap!"; .{-label:leap}{-counter-up:leap};
=
if a little pointlessly, generating first
= (text)
	jump L_leap_0; print "Yikes! A trap!"; .L_leap_0;
=
and then
= (text)
	jump L_leap_1; print "Yikes! A trap!"; .L_leap_1;
=
and so on. The point of this is that it guarantees we won't define two labels
with identical names in the same Inform 6 routine, which would fail to compile.

@<Inline command "label"@> =
	if (arg_L != NULL) {
		JumpLabels::write(arg_L, ist->operand);
	} else {
		TEMPORARY_TEXT(L)
		WRITE_TO(L, ".");
		JumpLabels::write(L, ist->operand);
		EmitCode::lab(EmitCode::reserve_label(L));
		DISCARD_TEXT(L)
	}
	return;

@ We can also output just the numerical counter:

@<Inline command "counter"@> =
	EmitCode::val_number((inter_ti) JumpLabels::read_counter(ist->operand, 0));
	return;

@ We can also output just the storage array:

@<Inline command "counter-storage"@> =
	EmitCode::val_iname(K_value, JumpLabels::storage_iname(ist->operand));
	return;

@ Or increment it, printing nothing:

@<Inline command "counter-up"@> =
	JumpLabels::read_counter(ist->operand, 1);
	return;

@ Or decrement it. (Careful, though: if it decrements below zero, an enigmatic
internal error will halt Inform.)

@<Inline command "counter-down"@> =
	JumpLabels::read_counter(ist->operand, -1);
	return;

@ We can use counters for anything, not just to generate labels, and one
useful trick is to allocate storage at run-time. Invoking
= (text)
	{-counter-makes-array:pineapple}
=
at any time during compilation (once or many times over, it makes no
difference) causes Inform to generate an array called |I7_ST_pineapple|
guaranteed to contain one entry for each counter value reached. Thus:
= (text as Inform 7)
To remember (N - a number) for later: ...
=
might be defined inline as
= (text)
	{-counter-makes-array:pineapple}I7_ST_pineapple-->{-counter:pineapple} = {N};
=
and the effect will be to accumulate an array of numbers during compilation.
Note that the value of a counter can also be read in template language,
so with a little care we can get the final extent of the array, too. If more
than one word of storage per count is needed, try:
= (text)
	{-counter-makes-array:pineapple:3}
=
or similar -- this ensures that the array contains not fewer than three times
as many cells as the final value of the count. (If multiple invocations are
made with different numbers here, the maximum is taken.)

@<Inline command "counter-makes-array"@> =
	int words_per_count = 1;
	if (Str::len(ist->operand2) > 0) words_per_count = Str::atoi(ist->operand2, 0);
	JumpLabels::allocate_storage(ist->operand, words_per_count);
	return;

@h High-level commands.
This category is intended for powerful and flexible commands, allowing for
invocations which behave like control statements in other languages. (See
also |{-block}| above, though that is syntactically a divider rather than
a command, which is why it isn't here.)

@<Expand a bracing containing a high-level command@> =
	if (C == my_ISINC)                      @<Inline command "my"@>;
	if (C == unprotect_ISINC)               @<Inline command "unprotect"@>;
	if (C == copy_ISINC)                    @<Inline command "copy"@>;
	if (C == initialise_ISINC)              @<Inline command "initialise"@>;
	if (C == matches_description_ISINC)     @<Inline command "matches-description"@>;
	if (C == now_matches_description_ISINC) @<Inline command "now-matches-description"@>;
	if (C == arithmetic_operation_ISINC)    @<Inline command "arithmetic-operation"@>;
	if (C == say_ISINC)                     @<Inline command "say"@>;
	if (C == show_me_ISINC)                 @<Inline command "show-me"@>;

@ The |{-my:name}| command creates a local variable for use in the invocation,
and then prints the variable's name. (If the same variable is created twice,
the second time it's simply printed.)

@<Inline command "my"@> =
	local_variable *lvar = NULL;
	int n = (int) (Str::get_at(ist->operand, 0) - '0');
	if ((Str::get_at(ist->operand, 1) == 0) && (n >= 0) && (n < 10))
		@<A single digit as the name@>
	else
		@<An Inter identifier as the name@>;
	inter_symbol *lvar_s = LocalVariables::declare(lvar);
	if (prim_cat == REF_PRIM_CAT) EmitCode::ref_symbol(K_value, lvar_s);
	else EmitCode::val_symbol(K_value, lvar_s);
	return;

@ In the first form, we don't give an explicit name, but simply a digit from
0 to 9. We're therefore allowed to create up to 10 variables this way, and
the ones we create will be different from those made by any other invocation
(including other invocations of the same phrase). See above.

@<A single digit as the name@> =
	lvar = my_vars[n];
	if (lvar == NULL) {
		my_vars[n] = LocalVariables::new_let_value(EMPTY_WORDING, K_number);
		lvar = my_vars[n];
		@<Set the kind of the new variable@>;
		if (IDTypeData::block_follows(idb))
			CodeBlocks::set_scope_to_block_about_to_open(lvar);
	}

@ The second form is simpler. |{-my:1}| and such make locals with names like
|tmp_3|, which we have no control over. Here we get to make a local with
exactly the name we want. This can't be reallocated, of course; it's there
throughout the routine, so there's no question of setting its scope. For example:
= (text as Inform 7)
To be warned:
	(- {-my:warn} = true; -).
To decide if we have been warned:
	(- ({-my:warn}) -).
=
The net result here is that if either phrase is used, then |warn| becomes a
local variable. The second phrase tests if the first has been used.

Nothing, of course, stops some other invocation from using a variable of
the same name for some quite different purpose, wreaking havoc. This is
why the numbered scheme above is mostly better.

@<An Inter identifier as the name@> =
	lvar = LocalVariables::new_internal(ist->operand);
	@<Set the kind of the new variable@>;

@ Finally, it's possible to set the I7 kind of a variable created by |{-my:...}|,
though there are hardly any circumstances where this is necessary, since Inter
is typeless. But in a few cases where I7 is embedded inside Inter inside I7,
or when a block value is needed, or where we need to match against descriptions
(see below) where kind-checking comes into play, it could arise. For example:
= (text)
	{-my:1:list of numbers}
=

@<Set the kind of the new variable@> =
	kind *K = NULL;
	if (Str::len(ist->operand2) > 0)
		K = CSIInline::parse_bracing_operand_as_kind(ist->operand2,
			Node::get_kind_variable_declarations(inv));
	if (K == NULL) K = K_object;
	LocalVariables::set_kind(lvar, K);

@ Variables created by phrases are by default protected from being changed
by other phrases. So that, for example, within:

>> repeat with X running from 1 to 5:

it's a problem message to say something like "let X be 7". This protection
only extends to changes made at the I7 source text level, of course; our own
I6 code can do anything it likes. Protection looks like a good idea,
especially for loop counters like X, but of course it would make phrases
like:

>> let Y be 2;

unable to make variables, only constants. So the |{-unprotect:...}| command
lifts the protection on the variable named:

@<Inline command "unprotect"@> =
	parse_node *v =
		CSIInline::parse_bracing_operand_as_identifier(ist->operand, idb, tokens, my_vars);
	local_variable *lvar = Lvalues::get_local_variable_if_any(v);

	if (lvar) LocalVariables::unprotect(lvar);
	else @<Issue a no-such-local problem message@>;
	return;

@ Something to be careful of is that a variable created with |{-my:...}|,
or indeed a variable created explicitly by the phrase, may not begin with
contents which are typesafe for the kind you intend it to hold. Usually this
doesn't matter because it is immediately written with some value which is
indeed typesafe, and there's no problem. But if not, |{-initialise:var:kind}|
takes the named local variable and gives it the default value for that kind.
If the kind is omitted, the default is to use the kind of the variable. For example,
= (text)
	{-my:1:time}{-initialise:1}
=
Note that this works only for kinds of word value, like "time". For kinds
of block value, like "list of numbers", it does nothing. This may seem odd,
but the point is that locals of that kind are automatically set to their
default values when created, so they are always typesafe anyway.

Note also that the Dash typechecker allows the creation of local variables
whose kinds are subkinds of objects which may have no instances. For example,
in this program:
= (text)
	A cat is a kind of animal.
	To discuss the felines:
		let C be a cat;
		...
=
...it is legal to construct the variable |C| with kind |cat|, even though there
are no cats in the world, so that a call to |DefaultValues::val| would
generate a problem message. But we call |DefaultValues::val_allowing_nothing|
instead, so that |C| is created but with the value |nothing|.

This would be easier to understand if Inform's kinds system supported "optionals".
In the Swift language, for example, there would be a clear distinction between
the types |Cat| (runtime values must be instances of cat) and |Cat?| (runtime
values must be instances of cat or else |nothing|). In Inform, cat-valued global
variables and properties have the type |Cat|, but cat-valued locals have the
type |Cat?|. We do this to make it more convenient to write functions about
cats which will compile whether or not any cats exist; an extension might provide
such functions, for example, providing functionality which is only used if cats
do exist, but which should still compile without errors even if they do not.

@<Inline command "initialise"@> =
	parse_node *V = CSIInline::parse_bracing_operand_as_identifier(ist->operand,
		idb, tokens, my_vars);
	local_variable *lvar = Lvalues::get_local_variable_if_any(V);

@ The |{-copy:...}| command allows us to copy the content in a token or variable
into any storage item (a local variable, a global, a table entry, a list entry),
regardless of its kind of value. For example:
= (text as Inform 7)
To let (t - nonexisting variable) be (u - value) (assignment operation):
	(- {-unprotect:t}{-copy:t:u} -).
=
This may look superfluous: for example, in response to "let X be 10" it generates
code equivalent to |tmp_0 = 10;|, which could have been achieved equally well with:
= (text)
	(- {-unprotect:t}{t} = {u}; -)
=
But it makes something much more elaborate in response to, say, "let Y be the
list of people in dark rooms", where it's important to keep track of the allocation
and deallocation of dynamic lists, since Y is a block value. The point of the
|{-copy:to:from}| command is to hide all that complexity from the definition.

@h Parsing the invocation operands.
Two ways. First, as an identifier name, which stands for a local Inter variable
or for a token in the phrase being invoked. There are three ways we can
write this:

(a) the operands "0" to "9", a single digit, mean the |{-my:...}| variables
with those numbers, if they exist;
(b) otherwise if we have the name of a token in the phrase being invoked,
then the operand refers to its value in the current invocation;
(c) and failing that we have the name of a local Inter variable.

@ The second sort of operand is a kind.

If the kind named involves kind variables A, B, C, ..., then these are
substituted with their values in the context of the invocation being made.
In addition two special kind names are recognised:
= (text)
	return-kind
	rule-return-kind
=
The former being the return kind from the phrase we are being invoked in
(if it's a phrase to decide a value), and the latter being the kind of value
which this rule should produce (if it's a rule, and if it's in a rulebook
which wants to produce a value). For example, you could define a phrase
which would safely abandon any attempt to define a value like this:
= (text as Inform 7)
To give up deciding:
	(- return {-new:return-kind}; -).

@h Bracket-plus notation.
An early compromise measure in the design of Inform 7, when the language was not
as expressive as it is today, was that "template files" of Inform 6 code, and
inline phrase definitions, could use the notation |(+ ... +)| to reinsert
high-level Inform 7 source text inside lower-level Inform 6 notation. Thus, for
example,
= (text)
	(- print (+ time of day +); -)
=
is a valid inline definition.

This is not (yet) deprecated, but is inelegant, and is used very little in Inform's
standard distribution. Requests to extend its abilities are very unlikely to be
heeded: it is more likely that we will curtail or abolish it.

The source text inside the |(+| and |+)| markers is evaluated as an expression,
rather than in void context, except that property names evaluate as nouns
referring to the property in the abstract rather than as conditions testing
those properties. Names of kinds of object (only) evaluate to Inter class
references for them. (Other kinds do not have Inter class references.)
