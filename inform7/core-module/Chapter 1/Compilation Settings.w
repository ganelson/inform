[CompilationSettings::] Compilation Settings.

Settings affecting the compilation of the current project.

@ The Inform compiler has many settings coming from outside: for example, a
command-line switch allows indexing to be turned off. This is not something a
program's own source text should be able to control. But it also has settings
such as whether or not to use the serial comma, which should indeed be
controllable from source text.

Those are called "compilation settings", and are a ragbag accumulated through
two decades of historical accident. Most correspond to use options. Some are
meaningful only for works of IF and are inert for Basic Inform projects.

need to translate this to other languages.

@ Some of the pragma-like settings are stored here:

=
typedef struct compilation_settings {
	int allow_engineering_notation;
	int dynamic_memory_allocation;
	int index_figure_thumbnails;
	int memory_economy_in_force;
	int no_deprecated_features;
	int no_verb_verb_exists;
	int number_rules_in_index;
	int ranking_table_given;
	int scoring_option_set;
	int use_exact_parsing_option;
        int no_auto_plural_names;
	int dictionary_resolution;
	int fast_route_finding;
	int slow_route_finding;
} compilation_settings;

compilation_settings global_compilation_settings;

@ Very early in compilation, the following is called:

=
void CompilationSettings::initialise_gcs(void) {
	global_compilation_settings.allow_engineering_notation = FALSE;
	global_compilation_settings.dynamic_memory_allocation = 0;
	global_compilation_settings.index_figure_thumbnails = 50;
	global_compilation_settings.memory_economy_in_force = FALSE;
	global_compilation_settings.no_deprecated_features = FALSE;
	global_compilation_settings.no_verb_verb_exists = FALSE;
	global_compilation_settings.number_rules_in_index = FALSE;
	global_compilation_settings.ranking_table_given = FALSE;
	global_compilation_settings.scoring_option_set = NOT_APPLICABLE;
	global_compilation_settings.use_exact_parsing_option = FALSE;
       	global_compilation_settings.no_auto_plural_names = FALSE;
	int N = 14;
	if (TargetVMs::is_16_bit(Task::vm())) N = 6;
	global_compilation_settings.dictionary_resolution = N;
	global_compilation_settings.fast_route_finding = FALSE;
	global_compilation_settings.slow_route_finding = FALSE;
}

@ And when (for example) a "Use..." sentence triggers one of these, the
following function is called. (Note that this is not the only way that
the above settings can be changed.)

=
void CompilationSettings::set(int U, int N, source_file *from) {
	compilation_settings *g = &global_compilation_settings;
	switch (U) {
		case AUTHORIAL_MODESTY_UO: {
			inform_extension *E = Extensions::corresponding_to(from);
			if (E == NULL) Extensions::set_general_authorial_modesty();
			else Extensions::set_authorial_modesty(E);
			break;
		}
		case ENGINEERING_NOTATION_UO:          g->allow_engineering_notation = TRUE; break;
		case MEMORY_ECONOMY_UO:                g->memory_economy_in_force = TRUE; break;
		case NO_DEPRECATED_FEATURES_UO:        g->no_deprecated_features = TRUE; break;
		case NO_SCORING_UO:                    g->scoring_option_set = FALSE; break;
		case NUMBERED_RULES_UO:                g->number_rules_in_index = TRUE; break;
		case SCORING_UO:                       g->scoring_option_set = TRUE; break;
		case UNABBREVIATED_OBJECT_NAMES_UO:    g->use_exact_parsing_option = TRUE; break;
        case NO_AUTO_PLURAL_NAMES_UO:          g->no_auto_plural_names = TRUE; break; 
		case FAST_ROUTE_FINDING_UO:            g->fast_route_finding = TRUE; break;
		case SLOW_ROUTE_FINDING_UO:            g->slow_route_finding = TRUE; break;
	}
	if (N > 0) {
		switch (U) {
			case DYNAMIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_UO: g->dynamic_memory_allocation = N; break;
			case INDEX_FIGURE_THUMBNAILS_UO:   g->index_figure_thumbnails = N;   break;
			case DICTIONARY_RESOLUTION_UO:     g->dictionary_resolution = N;            break;
		}
	}
}

@ Exact parsing in the //lexicon// module results from one such setting:

@d PARSE_EXACTLY_LEXICON_CALLBACK CompilationSettings::parse_exactly

=
int CompilationSettings::parse_exactly(excerpt_meaning *em) {
	if (em->meaning_code == NOUN_MC) {
		if (global_compilation_settings.use_exact_parsing_option) return TRUE;
		return FALSE;
	}
	return TRUE;
}
