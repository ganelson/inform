[SourceProblems::] Problems With Source Text.

Errors with the source text, either lexical issues or major syntactic ones, 
are found when Inbuild reads the text in: what this section does is to collect
and issue those errors as tidy Inform problem messages.

@ To trigger all of the problems listed below, test with the |:inbuild|
group.
