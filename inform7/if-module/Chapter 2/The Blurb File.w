[BlurbFile::] The Blurb File.

To write the blurb file of instructions for inblorb to release the project.

@ Releasing requires four programs to work together: this one, Inform 6
to turn our output into a story file, a releasing agent called "Inblorb"
which binds up the result into a blorbed file, and lastly the user interface,
which calls the other three in the right sequence.

Although the user interface looks as if it's in charge, in fact we are
pulling the strings, because we write a "blurb file" of instructions
telling Inblorb exactly what to do. The format for this is an extension of
the "blurb" format documented in the "Inform Designer's Manual",
fourth edition (the "DM4"); see the published source code for Inblorb.

Note that the code below does not generate an |author| blurb instruction,
which would lead to an AUTH chunk in the final blorb. This is partly
because the AUTH chunk is now obsolete in the wake of the Treaty of
Babel, but also because it avoids problems with Unicode: an AUTH can
only contain plainest ASCII, whereas the author's name known to Inform
may very well use characters not representable in ASCII. There is no
good way round this: so, farewell AUTH.

Similarly, we do not supply a release number. The release number of a blorb
has a different meaning from that of the story file embedded in it: the
number refers to the release of the picture and sound resources found
in the blorb, and we know nothing about that. (It's a feature provided
for archival re-releases of 1980s IF.)
