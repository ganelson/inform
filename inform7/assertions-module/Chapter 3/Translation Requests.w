[Translations::] Translation Requests.

Three unrelated senses of "X translates into Y as Z" sentences.

@h Translation into natural languages.

@h Translation into Unicode.
The following sentence form is now deprecated:

>> leftwards harpoon with barb upwards translates into Unicode as 8636.

Until Inform 10.1, this equated a Unicode name to its code point value; see
IE-0005 and //values: Unicode Literals// for what now happens instead.

The sentence "X translates into Y as Z" has this sense provided Y matches:

=
<translation-target-unicode> ::=
	unicode

@h Translation into Inter.
There are three sentences here, but the first is now deprecated: it has split
off into two different meanings, each with its own wording for clarity.

@d TRANSLATION_DEPRECATED_FORM 1
@d TRANSLATION_DEFINED_BY_FORM 2
@d TRANSLATION_ACCESSIBLE_TO_FORM 3

@ The sentence "X translates into Y as Z" has this sense provided Y matches the
following. Before the coming of Inter code, the only conceivable compilation
target was Inform 6, but these now set Inter identifiers, so really the first
wording is to be preferred.
