---- DOCUMENTATION ----

This extension was mechanically generated from the Unicode 4.1 draft.

It includes every named Unicode character in the hexadecimal range 0x0000 to 0x10000. Although the Unicode standard continues through 0x10000 and beyond into scripts for dead languages (such as Linear B and Old Persian), then very large far Eastern font encodings, the virtual computer which runs interactive fiction produced by Inform cannot write such characters, so nothing would be gained by naming them in Inform.

Warning: this is a very large extension, and its use slows Inform down.
