Tests Template.

The command grammar and I6 implementation for testing commands such
as TEST, ACTIONS and PURLOIN.

@h All testy.

=
#Ifdef DEBUG;

@h Abstract Command.
The code below is compiled only if the symbol |DEBUG| is defined, which it
always is for normal runs in the Inform user interface, but not for Release
runs.

Not all of these commands are documented; this is intentional. They may be
changed in name or function. This is all of the testing commands except for
the GLKLIST command, which is in Glulx.i6t (and does not exist when the
target VM is the Z-machine).

We take the commands in alphabetical order, beginning with ABSTRACT, which
moves an object to a new position in the object tree.

=
[ XAbstractSub;
    if (XTestMove(noun, second)) return;
    move noun to second;
    say__p = 1; "[Abstracted.]";
];

[ XTestMove obj dest;
    if (obj.component_parent) print_ret "[Can't move ", (name) obj, ": it's part of ",
        (the) obj.component_parent, ".]";
    while (dest) {
        if (dest == obj) print_ret "[Can't move ", (name) obj, ": it would contain itself.]";
        dest = CoreOfParentOfCoreOf(dest);
    }
    rfalse;
];

@h Actions Command.
ACTIONS turns tracing of actions on.

=
[ ActionsOnSub; trace_actions = 1; say__p = 1; "Actions listing on."; ];
[ ActionsOffSub; trace_actions = 0; say__p = 1; "Actions listing off."; ];

@h Gonear Command.
GONEAR teleports the player to the vicinity of some named item.

=
[ GonearSub;
	PlayerTo(LocationOf(noun));
];

@h Purloin Command.
To PURLOIN is to acquire something without reference to any rules on accessibility.

=
[ XPurloinSub;
    if (XTestMove(noun, player)) return;
    move noun to player; give noun moved; give noun ~concealed;
    say__p = 1;
    "[Purloined.]";
];

@h Random Command.
RANDOM forces the random-number generator to a predictable seed value.

=
[ PredictableSub;
    VM_Seed_RNG(-100);
    say__p = 1;
    "[Random number generator now predictable.]";
];

@h Relations Command.
RELATIONS lists the current state of the mutable relations.

=
[ ShowRelationsSub;
   IterateRelations(ShowOneRelation);
];

[ ShowOneRelation rel;
	if ((RlnGetF(rel, RR_PERMISSIONS)) & (RELS_SHOW)) {
		(RlnGetF(rel, RR_HANDLER))(rel, RELS_SHOW);
	}
];

@h Responses Command.
RESPONSES lists the known responses.

=
[ ShowResponsesSub a i j reg wd set_mode;
	if (NO_RESPONSES == 0) "There are no lettered responses.";
	wn = 2;
	if (NextWordStopped() == 'now') set_mode = 1; else wn--;
	if (NextWordStopped() == 'set') set_mode = 2; else wn--;
	wd = NextWordStopped(); wn--;
	if (wd == 'all') reg = 0;
	else {
		reg = -1;
		if (wd ~= -1) reg = TryNumber(wn);
		if (reg < 0) {
			say__p = 1;
   			print ">--> The following sets of responses are available:^";
			print "    RESPONSES ALL^";
		}
	}
	for (a=0, i=1, j=0: ResponseDivisions-->a: a=a+3, i++) {
		if (ResponseDivisions-->a ~= EMPTY_TEXT_PACKED) j++;
		if ((reg == 0) || (reg == j)) {
			if (ResponseDivisions-->a ~= EMPTY_TEXT_PACKED) {
				if (set_mode) {
					print "[", (string) ResponseDivisions-->a, "]^";
				} else {
					print (string) ResponseDivisions-->a, ":^";
				}
			}
			ShowResponsesRange(ResponseDivisions-->(a+1), ResponseDivisions-->(a+2), set_mode);
		}
		if (reg < 0) {
			if (ResponseDivisions-->a ~= EMPTY_TEXT_PACKED) {
				print "    RESPONSES ", j, ": ", (string) ResponseDivisions-->a, "^";
			}
		}
	}
];

[ ShowResponsesRange from to set_mode i;
	say__p = 1;
	for (i=from: i<=to: i++) {
		switch (set_mode) {
			1: print "now ";
			2: ;
			0: print "    ";
		}
		print (PrintResponse) i;
		switch (set_mode) {
			1: print " is ";
			2: print " is ";
			0: print ": ";
		}
		suppress_text_substitution = true;
		CarryOutActivity(PRINTING_RESPONSE_ACT, i);
		suppress_text_substitution = false;
		switch (set_mode) {
			1: print ";";
			2: print ".";
		}
		print "^";
	}
];

@h Rules Command.
RULES changes the level of rule tracing.

=
[ RulesOnSub;
	debug_rules = 1; say__p = 1;
	"Rules tracing now switched on. Type ~rules off~ to switch it off again,
	 or ~rules all~ to include even rules which do not apply.";
];
[ RulesAllSub;
	debug_rules = 2; say__p = 1;
	"Rules tracing now switched to ~all~. Type ~rules off~ to switch it off again.";
];
[ RulesOffSub;
	debug_rules = 0; say__p = 1;
	"Rules tracing now switched off. Type ~rules~ to switch it on again.";
];

@h Dialogue Command.
DIALOGUE changes the level of dialogue tracing.

=
[ DialogueOnSub;
	debug_dialogue = 1; say__p = 1;
	"Dialogue tracing now switched on. Type ~dialogue off~ to switch it off again,
	 or ~dialogue all~ to include even dialogue which do not apply.";
];
[ DialogueAllSub;
	debug_dialogue = 2; say__p = 1;
	"Dialogue tracing now switched to ~all~. Type ~dialogue off~ to switch it off again.";
];
[ DialogueOffSub;
	debug_dialogue = 0; say__p = 1;
	"Dialogue tracing now switched off. Type ~dialogue~ to switch it on again.";
];

@h Scenes Command.
SCENES switches scene-change tracing on or off, and also shows the current position.

=
[ ScenesOnSub;
	debug_scenes = 1;
	ShowSceneStatus(); say__p = 1;
	"(Scene monitoring now switched on. Type ~scenes off~ to switch it off again.)";
];
[ ScenesOffSub;
	debug_scenes = 0; say__p = 1;
	"(Scene monitoring now switched off. Type ~scenes~ to switch it on again.)";
];

@h Scope Command.
SCOPE prints a numbered list of all objects in scope to the player.

=
Global x_scope_count;
[ ScopeSub;
    x_scope_count = 0;
    LoopOverScope(Print_ScL, noun);
    if (x_scope_count == 0) "Nothing is in scope.";
];
[ Print_ScL obj; print_ret ++x_scope_count, ": ", (a) obj, " (", obj, ")"; ];

@h Showheap Command.
SHOWHEAP is for debugging the memory heap, and is intended for Inform
maintainers rather than users.

=
[ ShowHeapSub;
	HeapDebug();
];

@h ShowMe Command.
SHOWME is probably the most useful testing command: it shows the state of the
current room, or a named item.

=
[ ShowMeSub t_0 na;
	t_0 = noun;
 	if (noun == nothing) noun = real_location;
 	if (ShowMeRecursively(noun, 0, (noun == real_location))) {
 		if (noun == real_location)
			print "* denotes things which are not in scope^";
	}
 	if (t_0 ofclass K2_thing) {
 		print "location:"; ShowRLocation(noun, true); print "^";
 	}
 	if (t_0 ofclass K9_region) {
 		if (parent(t_0)) print "sub-region of: ", (the) parent(t_0), "^";
 	}
 	na = ShowMeKindDetails(false, na, t_0);
 	na = ShowMeInstanceDetails(false, na, t_0);
 	na = ShowMeKindDetails(true, na, t_0);
 	na = ShowMeInstanceDetails(true, na, t_0);
];

@h Showverb Command.
SHOWVERB is a holdover from old I6 days, but still quite useful. It writes
out the I6 command verb grammar for the supplied command.

@h Trace Command.
Another holdover from I6: TRACE sets the level of parser tracing, on a scale
of 0 (off, the default) to 5.

=
[ TraceOnSub; parser_trace=1; say__p = 1; "[Trace on.]"; ];

[ TraceLevelSub;
    parser_trace = parsed_number; say__p = 1;
    print "[Parser tracing set to level ", parser_trace, ".]^";
];

[ TraceOffSub; parser_trace=0; say__p = 1; "Trace off."; ];

@h Tree Command.
TREE prints out the I6 object tree, though this is not always very helpful
in I7 terms. It should arguably be withdrawn, but doesn't seem to do any harm.

=
[ XTreeSub i;
    if (noun == 0) {
        objectloop (i)
            if (i ofclass Object && parent(i) == 0) XObj(i);
    }
    else XObj(noun,1);
];

    if (parent(obj) == 0) print (name) obj; else print (a) obj;
    print " (", obj, ") ";
    if (f == 1 && parent(obj) ~= 0)
        print "(in ", (name) parent(obj), " ", parent(obj), ")";
    new_line;
    if (child(obj) == 0) rtrue;
    if (obj == Class)
        WriteListFrom(child(obj), NEWLINE_BIT+INDENT_BIT+ALWAYS_BIT+NOARTICLE_BIT, 1);
    else
        WriteListFrom(child(obj), NEWLINE_BIT+INDENT_BIT+ALWAYS_BIT+FULLINV_BIT, 1);
];

@h Grammar.
In the old I6 parser, testing commands had their own scope hardwired in to the
code: this worked by comparing the verb command word directly against |'scope'|
and the like. That would go wrong if the testing commands were translated into
other languages, and was a crude design at best. The following scope token is
better: using this token instead of |multi| provides a noun with universal
scope (but restricted to I7 objects, so I6 pseudo-objects like |compass| are
not picked up) and able to accept multiple objects.

=
[ testcommandnoun obj o2;
	switch (scope_stage) {
		1: rtrue; ! allow multiple objects
		2: objectloop (obj)
        	if ((obj ofclass Object) && (obj provides KD_Count))
            	PlaceInScope(obj, true);
        3: print "There seems to be no such object anywhere in the model world.^";
